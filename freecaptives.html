WARNING!
This	will	be	one	of	the	hardest	books	you	have	ever	tried	to	read.	SATAN
DOES	NOT	WANT	YOU	TO	READ	THIS	MATERIAL!
Heavenly	Father,	I	ask	you	to	shield	and	protect	the	reader	of	this	book
and	give	him	or	her	a	clear	understanding	of	all	that	you	have	directed	us
to	say.	I	ask	you	for	this,	and	thank	you,	in	the	precious	name	of	your
Son,	Jesus	Christ	our	Lord.	Amen.
The	purpose	of	this	book	is	to	show	you	the	many	ways	Satan	and	his	demons
are	at	work	in	the	world	today,	to	show	you	how	you	can	effectively	fight
against	them,	AND	how	you	can	be	set	free	from	bondage	to	Satan.
Satan	will	do	everything	he	can	to	keep	you	from	reading	this.	He	will	afflict
you	with	overwhelming	sleepiness,	confusion,	constant	interruptions	and	many
other	things.	FEAR	is	one	of	Satan’s	major	weapons.	He	will	use	fear	to	try	to
stop	you	from	reading	this	book.	You	simply	need	to	rebuke	fear	directly	and	out
loud	in	the	name	of	Jesus	Christ	to	overcome	it.	Also	pray	and	ask	for	shielding
as	you	read	in	order	to	understand	this	material.
My	deepest	appreciation	goes	first	to	the	Lord,	and	then	to	Elaine.	The	writing	of
this	book	would	not	have	been	possible	without	the	information	given	to	me	by
Elaine,	and	the	strength,	guidance	and	encouragement	given	to	me	by	the	Lord.
(I	have	written	Elaine’s	story	as	she	told	it	to	me.	Obviously	I	cannot	document
everything	in	her	story,	but	it	is	not	unique	in	that	many	many	others	coming	out
of	Satan’s	kingdom	give	similar	testimonies.)	All	names	have	been	changed	to
protect	the	people	involved	in	this	book.	We	pray	earnestly	that	the	Lord	Jesus
Christ	will	bless	you	richly	with	His	salvation	and	understanding	as	you	read	the
following	pages.
“And	he	[Jesus]	came	to	Nazareth,	where	he	had	been	brought	up:	and,
as	his	custom	was,	he	went	into	the	synagogue	on	the	sabbath	day,	and
stood	up	for	to	read.	And	there	was	delivered	unto	him	the	book	of	the
prophet	Esaias	[Isaiah].	And	when	he	had	opened	the	book,	he	found	the
place	where	it	was	written,	‘The	Spirit	of	the	Lord	is	upon	me,	because
he	hath	anointed	me	to	preach	the	gospel	to	the	poor;	he	hath	sent	me	to
heal	the	broken-hearted,	to	preach	deliverance	to	the	captives,	and
recovering	of	sight	to	the	blind,	to	set	at	liberty	them	that	are	bruised,	to

recovering	of	sight	to	the	blind,	to	set	at	liberty	them	that	are	bruised,	to
preach	the	acceptable	year	of	the	Lord.’
And	he	closed	the	book,	and	he	gave	it	again	to	the	minister,	and	sat	down.	And
the	eyes	of	all	them	that	were	in	the	synagogue	were	fastened	on	him.	And	he
began	to	say	unto	them,	this	day	is	this	Scripture	fulfilled	in	your	ears.”	Luke
4:16-21
HE	CAME	TO	SET	THE	CAPTIVES	FREE!

CHAPTER	1
Enter	Rebecca
From	the	first	moment	she	crossed	through	the	doorway	into	that	building,	she
sensed	that	there	was	something	different	about	the	place.	A	hovering	of
darkness,	as	it	were.	Something	she	could	not	define,	but	knew	was	there.	She
knew	also	that	it	was	something	that	she	had	never	experienced	before.
Rebecca	is	a	doctor.	She	was	just	entering	Memorial	Hospital	for	the	first	time	to
begin	her	training	in	internal	medicine.	She	had	finished	medical	school	the
previous	month	and	had	now	moved	away	from	home	really	for	the	first	time	in
the	30	years	of	her	life.	She	had	no	idea	that	the	tragedies	she	would	see	in	that
hospital	would	forever	change	both	her	and	the	course	of	her	life.	The	brooding
darkness	she	sensed	in	her	spirit	seemed	to	be	watchfully	waiting	...	waiting.
Suddenly	it	would	strike,	plunging	Rebecca	into	a	series	of	events	that	would
test	to	the	utmost	her	commitment	to	her	Lord	and	Savior,	Jesus	Christ.
The	first	test	was	quick	to	come	—	Rebecca	had	been	working	as	a	doctor	at	that
hospital	for	about	2	months.	One	night	while	she	was	working	in	the	Emergency
Room,	a	man	in	his	30’s	was	brought	in	about	2	A.M.	Rebecca	recoiled	in	horror
as	she	viewed	his	mangled	and	torn	body.	She	had	6	years	of	experience
working	in	Emergency	Rooms	(E.R.)	in	large	inner	city	hospitals	as	a	Registered
Nurse	prior	to	becoming	a	doctor,	but	she	had	never	seen	anything	like	this!	As
she	worked	rapidly	with	the	other	personnel	in	the	E.R.	to	save	the	young
pastor’s	life,	her	mind	raced.	How	could	this	be?	Who	would	do	such	a	thing?
He	had	obviously	been	tortured.	His	body	was	partially	skinned,	he	had	multiple
burns,	stab	wounds,	lashes	from	whips,	and	most	horrifying	of	all,	holes	in	the
palms	of	his	hands	from	spikes	being	driven	through	them.	He	was	unconscious
and	in	deep	shock.
After	the	initial	medical	care	was	done,	the	patient	stabilized	and	then	transferred
to	the	Intensive	Care	Unit,	Rebecca	looked	for	the	police	officers	who	had
brought	him	in.	They	had	little	to	say	other	than	the	fact	that	this	was	a
kidnapping	case.	They	had	found	the	body	and	at	first	thought	he	was	dead.
They	refused	to	talk	about	the	incident	any	further	and	left	quickly,	mumbling
something	about	having	to	file	their	report.
Everyone	else	in	the	E.R.	went	on	with	their	work	as	if	nothing	unusual	had

Everyone	else	in	the	E.R.	went	on	with	their	work	as	if	nothing	unusual	had
happened.	No	one	seemed	particularly	surprised	or	upset	about	the	condition	of
the	patient.	Again,	Rebecca	felt	overwhelmingly	that	brooding	darkness.	She
was	greatly	puzzled	and	concerned,	but	was,	herself,	quickly	caught	up	in	the
pressure	of	the	work	at	hand.	Nothing	in	her	background	could	possibly	have
prepared	her	for	the	shock	of	that	young	pastor’s	testimony	of	what	had
happened	to	him	prior	to	coming	into	the	Emergency	Room	that	night.	She	did
not	know	that	the	next	blow	would	come	to	one	of	her	own	patients	who	was
very	dear	to	her.
But	first,	let	us	trace	the	training	the	Lord	gave	Rebecca	to	prepare	her	for	all
that	was	to	happen.
Rebecca	had	the	tremendous	privilege	and	blessing	of	being	born	to	faithful
Christian	parents	who	prayed	daily	for	her.	She	had	accepted	Jesus	as	her	Savior
at	a	very	young	age,	but	knew	nothing	about	a	personal	walk	with	Him.	She	was
raised	in	a	very	tight	and	narrow	religious	group	and	was	not	permitted	to	form
friends	or	interact	with	anyone	outside	the	group.	She	was	rejected	both	within
the	group	and	without	—	mocked	and	ridiculed	at	school	and	by	the	other
members	of	the	religious	group;	she	grew	up	very	lonely.	She	also	had	much
illness,	spending	her	childhood	in	and	out	of	the	hospital.	Then	as	she	got	older,
she	was	discovered	to	have	an	incurable	and	debilitating	neuromuscular	disease.
But	her	loving	parents	provided	stability	in	her	life	and	their	prayers	surrounded
and	protected	her,	no	doubt	keeping	her	from	entering	the	occult	world	that
snares	so	many	other	young	people	with	similar	backgrounds.
During	the	first	year	of	medical	school	she	came	to	the	point	of	finally
committing	her	life	to	the	Lord	in	all	areas,	making	Jesus	the	master	in	her	life
as	well	as	Savior.	The	four	years	of	medical	school	were	an	intense	struggle
because	of	the	neuromuscular	illness	and	also	because	of	the	lack	of	finances.
During	those	four	years	Rebecca	learned	to	trust	the	Lord,	to	walk	with	Him	day
by	day,	to	hear	Him	speak	to	her	in	her	spirit,	to	follow	His	guidance,	and	to
experience	His	provision	for	her	every	need.
Before	medical	school	she	had	been	a	Registered	Nurse	for	seven	years.	Then,	as
a	result	of	the	Lord’s	powerful	working	in	her	life,	and	a	whole	string	of
miracles,	she	left	nursing,	returned	to	school	and	then	on	to	medical	school.
At	the	time	Rebecca	entered	Memorial	Hospital	she	knew	absolutely	nothing
about	Satanism	or	of	Elaine,	a	powerful	witch	who	lived	near	by.	Rebecca	never
dreamed	that	her	walk	with	Christ	in	that	hospital	would	cause	such	shock	waves
in	the	spirit	world	that	the	forces	of	darkness	would	become	enraged.	She

in	the	spirit	world	that	the	forces	of	darkness	would	become	enraged.	She
became	involved	in	a	titanic	struggle	as	Elaine,	one	of	the	top	witches	in	the
U.S.,	led	an	organized	attack	by	many	witches	using	all	of	their	powers	and
skills	of	witchcraft	to	try	to	kill	Rebecca.
The	internship	year	is	the	first	year	of	training	that	a	doctor	receives	after
graduating	from	medical	school,	if	he	or	she	is	going	to	specialize	in	something.
It	is	by	far	the	most	intense	year	of	training,	and	the	most	frightening	one.	It	was
no	different	for	Rebecca	at	Memorial	than	anyone	else	except	that	she	was
constantly	aware	of	something	so	strange	but	undefinable	about	that	hospital.	No
one	else	seemed	to	notice	it,	including	her	few	Christian	colleagues.	From	the
first	she	found	an	overwhelming	atmosphere	of	hatred,	back-biting	and	fighting
within	the	whole	department,	and	indeed,	within	the	whole	hospital	itself.	It	was
an	extremely	cold	atmosphere.	This	on	top	of	the	tremendous	physical	and
emotional	pressures	of	the	year	were	used	by	the	Lord	to	greatly	increase	her
closeness	to	Him.
She	found	almost	from	the	beginning	that	there	was	an	unusual	resistance	to	the
gospel.	Over	and	over	people	with	whom	she	tried	to	share	Jesus	would	flatly
refuse	to	even	listen.	In	fact,	within	six	months	of	the	start	of	her	training	at	that
hospital,	the	hospital	administration	had	all	the	Gideon	bibles	removed	from	the
patient	rooms	and	a	memo	was	posted	on	each	nursing	unit	stating	that	the
hospital	would	fire,	on	the	spot,	any	employee	who	was	caught	“evangelizing”
the	patients.	Also,	any	minister	that	was	coming	to	the	hospital	to	visit	patients
was	not	permitted	to	visit	with	anyone	except	their	own	private	parishioners,
and,	if	the	nurses	found	them	“evangelizing”	other	patients	they	were	to	have
them	escorted	from	the	hospital	by	security	and	asked	not	to	return	again.	A
chaplaincy	service	was	not	permitted,	which	was	also	unusual.	Indeed,	it	seemed
as	if	an	effort	was	being	made	to	wipe	away	any	mention	of	Christianity	within
the	walls	of	the	hospital.
Rebecca	was	first	assigned	to	the	intensive	care	unit	and	immediately	was
plunged	into	a	whirl-wind	of	activities.	She	spent	up	to	120	hours	per	week
working	at	the	hospital.	Because	of	this	schedule	she	attributed	the	steady
worsening	of	her	physical	condition	to	her	exhaustion.
Then	the	Lord	began	steadily	laying	upon	her	heart	that	she	must	go	into	the
hospital	early	each	morning	to	spend	an	hour	in	prayer	before	work	asking	the
Lord	for	that	institution	and	that	city,	that	the	gospel	would	be	proclaimed	and
bear	fruit.	As	she	began	obeying	the	Lord	and	praying	each	morning	an	hour
before	work,	repeatedly	she	found	herself	compelled	by	the	Holy	Spirit	to	pray
asking	the	Lord	to	restrain	the	powers	of	darkness	in	that	place.	Again	and	again

asking	the	Lord	to	restrain	the	powers	of	darkness	in	that	place.	Again	and	again
she	found	herself	quoting	Numbers	10:35	where	Moses	said:	“Rise	up,	Lord,	and
let	thine	enemies	be	scattered;	and	let	them	that	hate	thee	flee	before	thee.”
She	did	not	know	why	she	was	praying	in	this	manner,	and	indeed	sometimes
thought	that	it	was	strange	to	do	so,	but	over	and	over	the	Holy	Spirit	compelled
her	to	pray	in	such	a	manner.
As	the	Lord	steadily	increased	the	burden	on	her	heart	for	the	souls	in	that	place
she	began	to	pray	daily	asking	the	Lord	to	permit	her	to	stand	in	the	gap	for	the
hospital	and	the	city,	as	in	Ezekiel	22:30-31:	“And	I	sought	for	a	man	among
them,	that	should	make	up	the	hedge,	and	stand	in	the	gap	before	me	for	the
land,	that	I	should	not	destroy	it:	but	I	found	none.	Therefore	have	I	poured	out
mine	indignation	upon	them;	I	have	consumed	them	with	the	fire	of	my	wrath:
their	own	way	have	I	recompensed	upon	their	heads,	saith	the	Lord	God.”
She	was	not	sure	just	what	was	involved	in	“standing	in	the	gap”	but	asked	the
Lord	to	use	her	if	He	could.
During	Rebecca’s	first	few	months	at	Memorial,	God	taught	her	a	very	valuable
lesson	in	total	dependance	on	Him	in	her	medical	work.	Late	one	night	a	patient
was	admitted	to	the	Coronary	Care	Unit	with	severe	chest	pain,	high	blood
pressure	and	a	possible	heart	attack.	It	was	Rebecca’s	responsibility	to	examine
the	patient	and	care	for	him	that	night.	He	gave	her	a	list	of	the	medicines	that	he
was	taking	and	among	them	was	a	particularly	good	one	to	use	for	lowering
blood	pressure	while	simultaneously	taking	the	work	load	off	of	the	heart.	He
adamantly	stated	that	he	was	taking	a	particular	dose	and	Rebecca	accepted	his
word.	She	elected	to	give	him	that	dose	in	an	effort	to	lower	his	blood	pressure
and	to	relieve	the	work	load	on	his	heart	in	hopes	of	preventing	a	heart	attack.
What	she	did	not	know	was	that	that	dosage	is	very	dangerous	to	give	unless	she
had	herself	gradually	worked	the	patient	up	to	that	amount.
One	hour	later,	the	nurses	called	her	and	told	her	that	the	patient’s	blood
pressure	had	dropped	very	low,	that	he	was	in	shock	and	looked	as	if	he	were
dying.	Pure	terror	and	dismay	overwhelmed	her.	She	called	her	superior	and	told
him	about	the	situation	and	asked	what	could	be	done	to	reverse	the	effects	of
the	medicine	she	had	given.	He	coldly	told	her	that	she	had	made	a	stupid
mistake	and	that	there	was	absolutely	nothing	that	could	be	done,	except	to	see	if
the	patient	lived	or	died.	No	medicine	was	available	that	could	be	used	to	reverse
the	effects	of	the	one	she	had	given.	He	went	on	to	add	that	he,	too,	had	made	a
similar	mistake	as	an	intern	and	that	his	patient	had	sustained	greatly	extended
damage	to	his	heart	as	a	result	of	that	period	in	shock	and	had	nearly	died.

Many	thoughts	were	madly	racing	through	Rebecca’s	head	as	she	walked	down
the	lonely,	dark	halls	to	the	CCU	(Coronary	Care	Unit)	that	night	to	see	the
patient.	Guilt	and	fear	and	self-chastisement	were	uppermost	amongst	them.
Cold	sweat	ran	down	her	back	as	she	anguished	over	the	fact	that	in	all
probability	she	had	killed	the	patient.	Suddenly	the	Holy	Spirit	showed	her	the
error	of	the	thoughts	uppermost	in	her	mind.	She	had	been	thinking,	“God	made
an	orderly	universe	where	cause	and	effect	take	place	in	an	orderly	manner.
Because	of	your	stupid	mistake	this	man	will	probably	die.	Since	this	medicine
is	absolutely	irreversible,	the	effect	will	take	place,	so	there	is	no	need	even	to
pray	or	to	expect	God	to	break	into	his	orderly	universe	just	for	you	and	your
stupidity.”
Gently	the	Holy	Spirit	flooded	into	her	entire	being	the	sure	knowledge	that	she
was	different!	She	was	a	child	of	the	King!	And,	in	so	being,	had	a	special
privilege	that	the	other	doctor	had	not	had.	She	had	the	right	to	ask	God	the
Father,	in	Jesus’	name,	to	correct	her	mistake.	That	was	one	of	the	many	things
for	which	Jesus	had	died	on	the	cross.
She	abruptly	turned	and	ran	to	the	chapel	and	fell	on	her	knees	before	the	Lord
and	prayed	earnestly	asking	the	Lord	to	correct	her	mistake,	laying	claim	to	the
fact	that	she	was	a	child	of	the	King	and	standing	on	Hebrews	4:16:	“Let	us
therefore	come	boldly	unto	the	throne	of	grace,	that	we	may	obtain	mercy,	and
find	grace	to	help	in	time	of	need.”
She	arose	from	her	knees	and	went	back	down	to	the	CCU.	When	she	arrived
she	found	that	the	patient’s	blood	pressure	had	returned	to	normal	and	he	was
pain	free!	A	new	Electrocardiogram	showed	his	heart	had	returned	to	normal.	He
was	discharged	two	days	later	without	any	heart	damage	at	all.	.
Rebecca	also	learned	to	hear	the	Lord’s	guidance	more	acutely	on	an	hour-tohour	basis.	Time	after	time	He	would	speak	in	that	soft	voice	in	her	spirit,
bringing	a	mistake	to	her	attention	before	it	could	be	carried	out,	or	bringing	to
her	attention	something	she	had	forgotten	or	overlooked,	or	something	that	she
had	read	or	learned	about	in	the	past.	She	learned	to	fast	and	pray,	asking	the
Lord	to	reveal	to	her	the	key	to	the	diagnosis	of	particularly	obscure	cases.	She
also	learned	to	rely	on	the	Lord	to	give	her	skill	in	her	hands,	and	never
performed	any	procedure	on	any	patient	without	first	praying	and	asking	the
Lord	Jesus,	the	Great	Physician,	to	put	His	hands	within	hers	and	guide	them
with	His	skill.	In	all	of	her	years	so	far,	the	Lord	has	continuously	been	faithful
and	she	has	never	had	a	serious	complication	resulting	from	any	procedure	she
has	done.

About	six	months	into	her	internship,	just	as	Rebecca	was	again	assigned	to	the
Intensive	Care	Unit	(ICU),	the	young	pastor	she	saw	in	the	emergency	room
finally	recovered	enough	to	talk.	Rebecca	had	followed	his	progress	closely,
constantly	praying	for	him	and	was	drawn	by	the	Lord	to	frequently	stop	by	his
room	to	talk	with	him.	One	day	he	told	her	what	had	really	happened	just	prior
to	his	admission	to	the	hospital.
Bob	was	the	pastor	of	a	small	Christian	church	in	that	city.	He	had	become
involved	in	ministering	to	some	people	who	worshiped	Satan.	He	told	Rebecca
that	there	was	a	very	large	satanic	community	in	a	town	close	by,	and	that
Satanism	was	rampant	in	that	state.	He	had,	at	the	Lord’s	leading,	been	steadily
bringing	a	number	of	these	people	to	Jesus.	They	had	turned	from	serving	Satan
and	made	Jesus	Christ	their	Lord	and	Savior.	He	also	helped	them	cast	out	the
demons	that	they	had	asked	to	dwell	in	them	to	gain	powers	of	witchcraft.	The
night	Rebecca	first	saw	him,	he	had	been	kidnapped	by	the	satanists	and	taken	to
one	of	their	meetings.	He	was	taken	up	on	stage	in	front	of	the	group	and
tortured.	They	were	in	the	process	of	nailing	him	to	a	cross	when	one	of	the
members	shouted	out	that	someone	had	seen	something	suspicious	and	called	the
police.	(The	satanists	had	a	police	scanner	radio	and	monitored	all	the	calls.)
Bob	had	passed	out	while	being	crucified	and	knew	nothing	more	until	he	awoke
in	the	hospital	bed.
Rebecca	was	astounded,	she	had	never	heard	of	such	a	thing.	Perhaps	this	was
the	explanation	of	the	brooding	darkness	she	could	feel	in	that	hospital?	The
next	revelations	were	quick	to	follow.
As	she	started	into	her	second	rotation	in	the	Intensive	Care	Unit,	her	uneasiness
continued	to	grow.	Each	night	she	was	on	call,	she	had	the	responsibility	for	all
of	the	patients	in	the	critical	care	units.	She	began	noticing	as	she	was
prayerfully	working	with	the	patients	that	there	were	many	deaths	which,	to	her,
were	unexplainable.
There	is	normally	an	orderly	traceable	sequence	of	events	in	the	illness	and/or
death	of	any	patient.	For	example,	if	someone	went	into	shock	(low	blood
pressure)	because	he	was	bleeding	somewhere,	once	the	bleeding	was	stopped
by	surgery	or	whatever	and	the	blood	volume	he	had	lost	replaced	by	blood
transfusions,	the	patient’s	blood	pressure	should	not	suddenly	drop	unless	he
started	bleeding	again,	or	developed	some	other	complication	such	as	an
overwhelming	infection.
However,	many	of	the	patients	Rebecca	worked	with	would	just	reach	a
stabilized	condition	and	then	suddenly,	for	no	traceable	reason,	take	a	turn	for

stabilized	condition	and	then	suddenly,	for	no	traceable	reason,	take	a	turn	for
the	worse.	Their	heart	would	suddenly	stop	beating,	or	they	would	stop
breathing,	or	their	blood	pressure	would	drop	to	zero.	Many	of	these	died	shortly
despite	all	measures	taken	medically	to	save	them.	Rebecca	followed	up	on	the
autopsies	of	many	of	these	patients,	and	was	even	more	puzzled	when	no	cause
for	their	death	was	found	other	than	the	original	problem	which	had	brought
them	into	the	hospital.
The	other	problem	which	greatly	concerned	her	was	the	frequency	and	content
of	what	is	called,	in	the	medical	field,	an	“acute	ICU	psychosis.”	When	patients
undergo	the	great	stress	of	a	critical	illness,	they	are	placed	in	an	ICU	(Intensive
Care	Unit)	for	a	number	of	days,	usually	with	the	lights	on	24	hours	a	day,
monitors	going,	and	no	window	to	look	out	of.	Because	of	this	a	certain	percent
will	become	disoriented	and	start	to	have	hallucinations.	(That	is,	see	things	that
are	not	real.)	However,	in	this	hospital,	the	incidence	of	ICU	psychoses	was
many	times	more	than	anything	Rebecca	had	experienced	in	any	of	the	several
other	hospitals	she	had	worked	in,	both	as	a	R.N.	and	a	medical	student.
Rebecca	felt	led	by	the	Lord	to	take	the	time	to	talk	to	many	of	the	patients	about
just	what	they	were	“seeing.”	Much	to	her	surprise,	almost	all	of	them	told	her
that	they	had	seen	demons	in	their	rooms!
Greatly	concerned	about	all	of	this,	Rebecca	started	mentioning	the	incidence	of
deaths	and	ICU	psychoses	in	the	medical	conferences	held	with	all	the	interns
and	residents	each	morning.	Nobody	else	seemed	concerned,	or	even	to	believe
her.	After	her	third	attempt	to	discuss	the	problem	she	was	called	down	to	the
office	of	the	director	of	the	training	program	and	told	to	shut	her	mouth	on	the
subject,	that	she	was	not	experienced	enough	to	know	what	she	was	talking
about.	When	Rebecca	pointed	out	that	she	also	had	ten	years	experience	as	a
R.N.	in	addition	to	medical	school,	she	was	told	that	if	she	continued	to	create
trouble	she	would	be	kicked	out	of	the	training	program.
Her	morning	prayer	sessions	took	on	a	new	intensity	as	she	earnestly	sought	a
revelation	from	the	Lord	as	to	what	was	going	on.	The	first	break-through	came
through	one	of	her	own	patients.
Pearl	was	an	elderly	black	lady	from	the	Southern	United	States	who	had	been
under	Rebecca’s	care	for	about	six	months.	Pearl	was	a	very	strong	Christian	and
Rebecca	had	come	to	know	her	well	and	love	her	very	much.	One	evening	Pearl
came	to	the	hospital	very	ill	and	Rebecca	admitted	her	to	the	Intensive	Care
Unit.	The	next	morning	as	Rebecca	went	to	the	ICU	to	start	making	rounds	the
nurses	told	her	that	Pearl	was	having	an	ICU	psychosis.	Rebecca	was	somewhat
startled,	because	she	knew	Pearl	was	a	very	strong	Christian,	a	lady	who	had

startled,	because	she	knew	Pearl	was	a	very	strong	Christian,	a	lady	who	had
suffered	much	and	didn’t	panic	easily.
As	she	went	into	Pearl’s	room	she	found	her	crying.	When	she	asked	her	why,
Pearl	told	her	that	if	she	did	not	transfer	her	out	of	the	ICU	that	day	that	“that
night	nurse	would	kill	her.”	Then	Pearl	told	Rebecca	about	how	the	night	shift
nurse	caring	for	her	had	come	in	and	talked	to	her	and	told	her	that	there	was	no
need	for	her	to	fight	to	stay	alive,	that	she	could	so	easily	be	reincarnated	into
her	next	life.	The	nurse	also	told	Pearl	that	she	would	call	on	“the	higher
powers”	to	come	and	escort	Pearl	into	her	next	“beautiful	life.”	When	the	nurse
laid	her	hands	on	Pearl	and	spoke	words	of	a	foreign	sounding	language,	Pearl
recognized	it	to	be	an	incantation.	Pearl	knew	from	her	own	heritage	about
voodoo	and	black	magic	and	demons,	and	she	declared	that	she	had	seen	demons
in	the	room.	She	told	Rebecca	that	she	was	too	weak	to	fight	anymore	and	if	the
same	thing	would	happen	tonight	she	knew	she	would	die.
Rebecca	was	astounded!	She	knew	Pearl	well	enough	that	she	didn’t	think	she
was	lying	and	she	was	sure	that	she	wasn’t	disoriented	in	any	way.	The	nurse
Pearl	was	referring	to	happened	to	be	the	nurse	in	charge	of	the	ICU	on	the	night
shift.	She	was	an	older	lady,	pleasant,	attractive	and	an	excellent	nurse.	She	was
well	organized,	knowledgeable	and	saw	to	it	that	the	patients	got	good	care.	She
was	highly	respected	by	the	medical	staff	and	the	rest	of	the	nursing	staff.
Rebecca	had	always	found	her	a	bit	cold	and	withdrawn,	but	had	thought	it	was
the	pressures	of	her	work	load.	She	could	not	find	fault	with	her	work	in	any
way.
Rebecca	knew	she	could	not	talk	to	any	of	her	colleagues	about	the	problem
because	they	would	all	say	that	she	was	crazy.	Neither	could	she	accuse	the
nurse	of	anything	because	she	had	no	proof.	At	that	time	Rebecca	had	very	little
knowledge	of	witches	and	almost	no	knowledge	about	demons.	There	was	only
one	thing	she	could	do.	She	took	the	problem	to	the	Lord	in	prayer.	Every	spare
moment	she	had	that	day	was	spent	on	her	knees	in	prayer	down	in	the	chapel.
(She	always	had	the	chapel	to	herself	because	no	one	else	ever	used	it.)	Late	in
the	day,	the	Lord	confirmed	to	her	heart	that	Pearl	was	telling	the	truth.	The
Lord	also	commanded	Rebecca	to	go	and	sit	at	Pearl’s	bedside	all	night	that
night	as	Pearl	was	too	ill	to	be	safely	transferred	out	of	the	ICU.	This	was
possible	as	Rebecca	was	not	on	call	that	particular	night.
What	happened	that	night	was	to	change	Rebecca’s	life	forever.	As	she	sat	at
Pearl’s	bedside,	not	really	expecting	anything	to	happen,	she	felt	direct	demonic
oppression	as	she	had	never	felt	it	before.	Helen,	the	nurse	in	charge	of	the	ICU,
did	not	come	into	Pearl’s	room	at	all	that	night.	Rebecca	felt	an	incredible

did	not	come	into	Pearl’s	room	at	all	that	night.	Rebecca	felt	an	incredible
unseen	power	coming	against	her.	She	felt	as	if	there	was	a	giant	unseen	hand
trying	to	squash	her	into	a	little	grease	spot	on	the	floor	and	as	if	some	unseen
force	was	trying	to	suck	the	very	life	out	of	her.	She	tried	to	scientifically	reason
the	feeling	away,	tried	to	convince	herself	that	it	was	just	her	own	imagination,
but	none	of	this	helped.	She	felt	her	body	beginning	to	weaken	to	the	point
where	she	could	hardly	sit	up.	Pearl	felt	it	too.	So,	she	and	Pearl	joined	hands,
and	Rebecca	prayed	quietly	asking	the	Lord	to	cover	them	with	a	shield	of	the
precious	blood	of	Jesus.
“And	they	overcame	him	[Satan]	by	the	blood	of	the	Lamb,	and	by	the
word	of	their	testimony	...”
Revelation	12:11
That	night	was	a	tremendous	struggle,	but	Pearl	came	through	the	night	safely
and	Rebecca	transferred	her	out	of	the	ICU	that	morning.
The	next	revelations	came	quickly.	Rebecca	was	teaching	a	weekly	bible	study
to	some	of	the	nurses	whom	she	had	led	to	the	Lord.	One	of	these	nurses,	Jean,
finally	started	talking	to	her	one	day	about	the	Satanism	that	she	had	become
involved	with	prior	to	her	conversion.	She	told	Rebecca	that	Helen	had	been
training	her	to	become	a	medium	and	that	she	had	been	ready	to	be	initiated	into
the	group	of	satanists	just	when	Rebecca	came	to	the	hospital	and	had	started
talking	to	her	about	the	Lord.	As	a	result,	she	had	made	Jesus	her	Lord	and
savior	and	had	refused	to	have	anything	more	to	do	with	Helen	or	the	other
witches.
However,	Jean	was	obviously	very	afraid	of	Helen	and	her	friends.
Jean	told	Rebecca	that	she	knew	that	Helen	considered	it	her	“ministry”	to
assign	herself	to	care	for	the	most	critically	ill	patients	in	the	ICU.	Then	while
she	was	caring	for	them,	she	would	talk	to	them	and	tell	them	that	there	was	no
need	for	them	to	struggle	to	live	as	they	could	be	so	easily	reincarnated	into	their
next	life	and	have	no	more	suffering.	Then,	with	or	without	their	consent,	she
would	lay	her	hands	on	them	and	call	up	demon	spirits	which	she	called	the
“higher	powers”	to	come	and	usher	these	patients	on	into	their	next	life.	Often,
these	patients	would	soon	take	a	turn	for	the	worse	and	die.	Jean	was	afraid	to
tell	anyone	else	about	the	problem	because	Helen	was	held	in	high	regard	by	the
head	nurse	and	other	authorities,	and	knew	that	they	would	not	believe	her.	In
fact,	after	Jean	had	turned	to	Christ,	she	had	arranged	a	transfer	to	another	shift
so	that	she	would	not	be	working	with	Helen.

Jean	also	told	Rebecca	about	the	occult	community	close	to	that	city	which	had
one	of	the	largest	distribution	centers	of	occult	literature	in	the	U.S.,	a	very	large
training	camp	for	witches	and	also	had	a	satanist	church.	She	confirmed	to
Rebecca	all	that	the	young	pastor	had	told	her	and	was	very	afraid	that	the	same
thing	might	happen	to	her.	No	one	around	seemed	to	take	the	community	very
seriously,	but	that,	of	course,	was	precisely	what	Satan	wanted.
Then	Rebecca	learned	from	several	other	sources	about	other	nurses	and	doctors
at	the	hospital	that	were	involved	in	the	occult,	and	about	the	satanist	cult	and
community.	Again	she	took	the	situation	to	the	Lord	and	received	confirmation.
She	began	studying	her	Bible	earnestly	to	learn	more	about	Satan	and	his
demons.	She	learned	that	people	could	be	inhabited	by	demons	and	could	use
demonic	powers	to	do	all	sorts	of	things.	It	was	at	that	point	that	she	began	to
enter	into	active	warfare	against	Helen	and	the	other	satanists	who	worked	at	the
hospital.
In	her	morning	prayer	sessions	she	began	to	ask	the	Lord	to	bind	the	demonic
powers	within	that	place	and	in	the	specific	people	she	knew	were	involved.
Daily,	in	the	evenings	before	Rebecca	left	the	hospital,	she	would	walk	through
the	ICU	and	other	wards,	and	very	quietly	but	out	loud,	take	authority	over	every
demon	spirit	in	those	places	that	either	were	there	already,	or	that	would	come
there	the	rest	of	the	day	and	night,	and	bind	them	with	the	power	of	the	name	of
Jesus	Christ.	She	also	asked	the	Lord	to	place	a	special	shield	around	the	patients
to	protect	them	from	the	demonic	forces.
Many	nights	when	she	was	on	call,	she	would	be	called	up	to	the	ICU,	or	one	of
the	wards	to	see	a	patient	who	had	taken	a	turn	for	the	worse.	As	God	gave
Rebecca	discernment	as	to	which	problems	were	the	result	of	demonic
interference	she	learned	to	stand	on	Luke	10:19:	“Behold	I	give	unto	you	power
to	tread	on	serpents	and	scorpions,	and	over	all	the	power	of	the	enemy:	and
nothing	shall	by	any	means	hurt	you.”
and	Mark	16:17:
“And	these	signs	shall	follow	them	that	believe;	in	my	name	shall	they
cast	out	devils...	”
Many	times	she	would	stand	on	one	side	of	a	patient’s	bed	silently	battling	in
prayer,	binding	the	demons	and	commanding	them	to	leave,	and	claiming	a
shield	of	faith	in	Jesus	Christ	over	the	patient,	while	Helen	(or	one	of	the	other
nurses	who	was	a	witch)	stood	on	the	other	side	of	the	bed	directing	all	the
demon	power	available	to	her,	both	at	Rebecca	and	against	the	patient.	Rebecca
would	also,	or	course,	use	all	of	her	medical	knowledge	to	try	to	reverse	the

would	also,	or	course,	use	all	of	her	medical	knowledge	to	try	to	reverse	the
downward	course	of	the	patient,	but	she	quickly	learned	that	all	of	her	medical
knowledge	was	of	little	help	if	it	was	not	combined	with	the	spiritual	battling	in
prayer.
Of	course,	Helen,	Satan,	and	the	other	witches	did	not	take	kindly	to	Rebecca’s
activities,	and	the	battle	mounted.	Rebecca	tried	to	share	with	a	couple	of	her
Christian	co-workers	what	was	going	on,	but	they	refused	to	believe	her	and	told
her	that	she	was	just	ill,	and	overtired,	and	imagining	things.
As	the	battle	increased	in	intensity,	Rebecca’s	neuromuscular	disease	worsened.
She	came	under	the	care	of	one	of	the	top	doctors	on	the	staff	of	that	hospital.
Despite	all	her	prayers	and	the	medical	efforts	made	on	her	behalf,	she	was
dying,	and	knew	it.	Finally,	on	the	last	day	of	her	internship	year,	she	became
too	ill	to	work	any	more.	A	consultation	was	held	with	several	of	the	specialists
involved	in	her	case	and	she	was	told	that	they	did	not	think	she	had	long	to	live.
There	was	nothing	more	they	could	do.	They	asked	her	if	she	wanted	to	be
admitted	to	the	hospital	there,	or	to	go	home.	She	decided	to	go	home.	So
Rebecca	left	that	city	and	hospital	thinking	that	she	would	never	see	it	again,	but
her	heart	was	so	heavy	and	grieved	for	the	many,	many	people	in	that	place	so
lost	and	held	captive	by	the	powers	of	darkness.
Then	followed	an	agonizing	month	in	which	her	illness	progressed	to	the	place
where	she	was	so	weak	that	she	could	not	walk,	or	even	get	out	of	bed	by
herself.	But	through	it	all	she	had	a	complete	and	beautiful	peace.	Jesus	was	in
control,	that	was	all	that	mattered.	Night	after	night	as	she	lay	awake,	in	too
much	pain	to	sleep,	she	had	sweet	communion	with	her	Lord	and	fervently
hoped	that	it	would	be	His	will	to	call	her	home	soon.
One	day	towards	the	end	of	that	long	month,	the	pastor	of	her	home	church,
Pastor	Pat,	came	to	visit	her.	Being	the	man	of	God	that	he	was,	Pastor	Pat	had
not	just	accepted	the	fact	that	Rebecca	was	to	die,	but	had	taken	the	matter	to	the
Lord	in	prayer.	He	came	and	talked	with	her	and	told	her	that	the	Lord	had
revealed	to	him	that	it	was	not	His	will	for	Rebecca	to	die.
Then	he	said,	“I	know	this	sounds	crazy,	but	I	believe	the	Lord	has	revealed	to
me	that	what	is	happening	to	you	is	that	you	are	being	attacked	by	a	group	of
very	powerful	witches.	Your	illness	has	worsened	to	this	point	because	of	the
demonic	powers	they	are	sending	to	you.	Is	this	possible?	Have	you	been	in
contact	with	any	witches	that	you	know	of?”
Suddenly	Rebecca	understood!	Why	hadn’t	she	associated	the	worsening	of	her
own	condition	with	the	battle	she	had	been	fighting	against	the	satanists	in	that

own	condition	with	the	battle	she	had	been	fighting	against	the	satanists	in	that
hospital?	She	had	never	talked	to	Pastor	Pat	about	any	of	her	experiences,	so	she
told	him	about	all	that	had	been	happening	the	past	year.
He	paced	the	floor	in	deep	concern,	then	turned	to	her	and	said,	“I	know	it	is	not
the	Lord’s	will	for	you	to	die.	I	have	no	doubts	at	all	now	that	your	illness	is	a
direct	result	of	witchcraft.	We	must	pray	and	block	the	power	of	those	witches.”
And	pray	he	did!	Not	only	the	pastor,	but	the	elders	and	also	about	200	members
of	that	church	fasted	and	prayed	around	the	clock	for	a	whole	week,	interceding
for	Rebecca,	asking	the	Lord	to	shield	her	and	break	the	power	of	the	witches
who	were	coming	against	her.
Toward	the	end	of	that	week,	one	night	as	Rebecca	lay	in	bed,	drifting	on	the
edge	of	unconsciousness,	the	Lord	brought	to	her	mind	a	portion	that	she	had
read	in	Watchman	Nee’s	book:	“Unless	a	Christian	plainly	knows	his	work	is
finished	and	he	no	longer	is	required	by	the	Lord	to	remain,	he	should	by	all
means	resist	death.	If	the	symptoms	of	death	have	been	seen	already	in	his	body
before	his	work	is	done,	he	positively	should	resist	it	and	its	symptoms.
To	concede	—	by	sizing	up	of	our	environment,	physical	condition,	and	feeling
—	that	our	time	has	come	is	an	error	on	our	part;	we	instead	need	to	possess
definite	indications	from	the	Lord.	As	we	live	for	Him,	so	must	we	die	for	Him.
Any	call	for	departure	which	does	not	come	from	the	Lord	ought	to	be	opposed.
To	overcome	death	believers	must	alter	their	attitude	from	one	of	submission	to
one	of	resistance	towards	it.	Unless	we	cast	off	our	passive	approach	we	will	not
be	able	to	overthrow	death	but	will	be	mocked	by	it	instead	and	finally	come	to
an	untimely	end.	Numerous	saints	today	misapprehend	passivity	for	faith.	They
reason	that	they	have	committed	everything	to	God.	If	they	ought	not	to	die,	He
verily	shall	save	them	from	it:	if	they	ought	to	die,	then	He	doubtless	shall	allow
them	to	die:	let	the	will	of	God	be	done.	Such	a	saying	sounds	right,	but	is	this
faith?	Not	at	all.	It	is	simply	lazy	passivity.	When	we	do	not	know	God’s	will,	it
is	fitting	for	us	to	pray:	‘not	my	will,	but	thine,	be	done’	(Luke	22:42).	This	does
not	mean	we	need	not	pray	specifically,	letting	our	requests	be	made	known	to
God.	We	should	not	submit	passively	to	death,	for	God	instructs	us	to	work
together	actively	with	His	will.	Except	we	definitely	know	God	wants	us	to	die,
we	must	not	passively	permit	death	to	oppress	us.	Rather	we	must	actively
cooperate	with	God’s	will	to	resist	it.	Why	should	we	adopt	such	an	attitude	as
this?	The	Bible	treats	death	as	our	enemy.”	(1	Cor	15:26)	From	The	Spiritual
Man,	by	Watchman	Nee,	pp.	216-219.
As	the	Lord	brought	to	her	memory	the	above	passages,	the	Holy	Spirit	quietly

As	the	Lord	brought	to	her	memory	the	above	passages,	the	Holy	Spirit	quietly
spoke	to	Rebecca	and	told	her	that	it	was	not	the	Father’s	will	for	her	to	die,	that
she	had	much	work	yet	to	do.	She	must	begin	to	stand	up	and	resist	Satan,	and
refuse	to	accept	illness	or	death	from	him.	She	struggled	for	awhile,	because	in
her	heart	of	hearts,	she	did	not	want	to	live.	She	did	not	want	to	struggle	any
longer,	she	wanted	to	go	to	heaven	with	her	Lord	and	have	all	the	peace	and	joy
that	she	knew	awaited	her	there.	But	the	quiet,	soft,	voice	of	the	Holy	Spirit	was
insistent.
Finally,	with	many	tears,	she	placed	her	feet	on	“The	Rock”	and	began	to	rebuke
Satan	and	command	him	in	the	name	of	Jesus	to	leave	—	that	she	would	not
accept	any	more	of	the	illness	he	sought	to	put	on	her,	and	that	she	would	not
accept	death.	Later	the	Lord	revealed	to	Rebecca	that	the	only	reason	He	had
been	able	to	break	through	that	night	and	reveal	to	her	that	He	wanted	her	to
stand	up	and	fight	and	resist	death,	was	because	of	the	powerful	intercession	by
Pastor	Pat	and	the	church	people.
Rebecca	had	so	much	muscle	damage	that	she	had	a	three	months	recovery
period,	but	the	Lord	raised	her	up	and	completely	healed	her.	So	she	returned	to
Memorial	Hospital	to	finish	her	last	two	years	of	training,	ready	at	last	for	the
meeting	the	Lord	was	arranging	with	Elaine,	the	head	witch	who	had	led	the
attempt	to	kill	her.

CHAPTER	2
Enter	Elaine

ELAINE	TALKS:
My	mother	and	father’s	marriage	was	a	very	shaky	one.	My	father	was	a
drunkard	who	believed	that	he	was	God’s	gift	to	women.	He	mistreated	my
mother	very	badly.	When	I	was	born	he	stood	at	the	foot	of	her	bed	and	told	her
that	he	wished	I	was	dead	over	and	over,	until	she	finally	threw	a	vase	at	him.
My	birth	was	like	any	other	birth,	like	hundreds	born	on	that	same	day	all	over
the	world,	except	that	I	was	born	deformed.	I	had	no	nose,	no	upper	lip,	no	roof
in	my	mouth.	This	is	what	is	called	a	severe	hair-lip	with	a	cleft-palate.	My
mother	wanted	to	see	me	right	away	as	soon	as	I	was	born,	and	to	her	I	was	a
beautiful	baby,	even	with	the	deformities.	Her	first	question	was,	“Can	she	be
fixed?”
She	was	in	absolute	poverty.	She	had	no	money	and	no	way	of	making	any.	In
those	days	the	welfare	programs	were	not	available	as	they	are	today,	but	my
mother	was	not	the	type	to	give	up	just	because	she	was	poor.
It	so	happened	that	in	that	same	hospital	there	was	a	nurse	called	Helen.	She	had
assisted	at	my	birth.	Helen	knew	my	mother’s	circumstances	and	also	of	my
father’s	attitude	of	hatred.	Helen	wasn’t	just	an	ordinary	nurse,	she	was	also	a
powerful	witch	and	a	member	of	what	has	become	one	of	the	most	powerful	but
little	known	cults	in	our	country	today.	This	cult	calls	themselves	The
Brotherhood	and	is	a	Satan-worshiping	cult.	Helen	was,	at	that	time,	what	is
known	within	the	cult	as	a	“contact	person.”	Her	contact	with	my	mother	was	to
affect	the	rest	of	my	entire	life,	as	well	as	the	life	of	Rebecca.
The	day	following	my	birth	Helen	approached	my	mother	with	a	proposition.	If
my	mother	would	give	Helen	permission	to	take	a	very	small	amount	of	my
blood,	she	and	her	“friends”	would	provide	a	way	to	get	finances	and	the	help
she	needed	to	obtain	the	best	surgical	and	medical	care	for	me	that	was
available.	My	mother	could	not	understand	just	why	Helen	would	do	all	this	in
return	for	seemingly	so	small	a	thing.	She	could	never	seem	to	grasp	the
meaning	of	what	Helen	explained	to	her.	But,	as	there	seemed	to	be	no	other
source	of	the	desperately	needed	help,	and	as	Helen	repeatedly	reassured	her	that
she	would	not	harm	me,	my	mother	finally	agreed	to	the	proposition.	Helen	was
an	attractive	young	lady	who	seemed	genuinely	concerned	and	sincere	in	her
desire	to	help	both	me	and	my	mother.

What	Helen	did	not	explain	to	my	mother	was	that	my	blood	was,	for	her,	a	very
important	“sale.”	The	small	container	of	blood	taken	from	me	was	given	to
another	woman	called	Grace.	Grace	was	also	in	the	satanist	cult.	She	was	what	is
known	as	a	high	priestess.	The	selling	of	my	blood	was	to	give	Grace	more
power,	more	activity	and	a	higher	position	within	the	cult.	Helen,	too,	obtained
more	power	through	this	transaction.
The	blood	was	taken	by	Helen	and	given	to	Grace.	Grace	then	drank	my	blood
during	a	ceremony	which	gave	both	Grace	and	Satan	possession	of	me,	and
opened	me	up	as	a	home	for	many	demons	from	that	moment	on.	Grace,	at
Satan’s	direction,	sent	many	specific	spirits	into	me	which	would	mold	and
shape	my	life	and	personality	and	future.
My	mother	was	not	a	Christian,	neither	did	she	know	that	what	she	did	would
make	me	a	marked	person,	carefully	watched	by	the	satanists,	and	would,	later	in
my	life,	result	in	my	own	involvement	in	the	cult.	Had	she	known	that,	my
mother	never	would	have	said,	“O.K.,	you	can	have	a	little	of	her	blood.”	Later
on	in	my	life	as	a	member	of	the	cult	myself,	I	was	to	witness	a	number	of	such
sales	and	always	my	heart	grieved	as	I	thought	about	the	consequences	in	the
baby’s	future	life.
Satan	now	had	a	prized	possession.	A	new	born	baby	where	demons	and	spirits
could	have	a	home	and	could	grow	and	become	very	powerful	and	agile	in	my
life.	As	I	became	more	and	more	aware	of	myself,	even	in	my	younger	days,	I
knew	something	different	and	special	was	going	on	within	me,	but	didn’t	know
what	it	was.
Four	days	after	my	birth,	my	mother	was	approached	and	told	that	she	could	take
me	to	a	children’s	hospital	at	a	nearby	large	medical	center.	There	I	would	have
a	number	of	surgeries.	Very	many.	As	a	matter	of	fact,	it	took	sixteen	years	of
plastic	surgery	to	build	a	face	for	me.	I	also	had	to	have	long	hours	of	speech	and
hearing	therapy,	dental	work,	everything.	This	was	the	beginning	of	many	years
of	pain,	loneliness,	and	rejection.	Pain,	because	plastic	surgery	burns	with
agonizing	pain	during	the	days	of	healing	after	a	surgery.	Loneliness,	because	I
was	not	like	the	other	children.	Rejection,	because	of	their	reaction	to	my
disfigurement.	I	had	very	few	friends.	I	became	very	rough,	a	fighter.	I	learned
to	fight	and	fight	very	well	in	order	to	be	able	to	stand	up	for	myself.	I	had	so
many	interruptions	of	my	schooling	because	of	the	surgeries	that	it	was	difficult
for	me	to	maintain	the	few	friendships	I	did	form.
The	children	at	school	seemed	to	enjoy	prodding	me	and	poking	me	and	pushing
me	and	making	fun	of	me	until	I	could	hardly	stand	it	anymore.	We	moved	from

me	and	making	fun	of	me	until	I	could	hardly	stand	it	anymore.	We	moved	from
school	to	school	so	that	I	never	went	to	the	same	school	two	years	in	a	row.	My
parents	thought	it	would	help	if	I	never	had	to	face	the	same	group	of	school
children	a	second	year.	But,	I	did	face	the	same	children	again	and	again.	Every
school	was	the	same,	the	reactions	were	the	same.	Nothing	changed,	year	after
agonizing	year.
My	mother	remarried	shortly	after	my	birth.	My	parents	didn’t	go	to	church.
They	didn’t	deny	me	the	right	to	go,	but	they	did	not	go.	They	were	“waiting	on
each	other.”	And,	like	most	people,	if	you	wait	on	someone	long	enough,	you’ve
waited	too	long	if	you	don’t	take	the	first	step	yourself.
I	finally	did	join	a	youth	group	at	a	church.	It	was	quite	an	active	group	in	a
Pentacostal	Church.	I	was	sixteen	years	old	by	then	and	was	accepted	by	the
church	youth	group	because	I	could	sing,	and	play	the	guitar	and	drums.	I	had
many	talents	in	the	musical	field	as	well	as	the	art	field.	It	was	a	rather	happy
time	for	me	for	a	short	while.
As	I	grew	up	I	found	that	I	had	unexplainable	powers	and	I	didn’t	know	what	to
do	with	them,	or	what	they	were,	or	where	they	came	from.	Some	people	told	me
I	had	special	“gifts.”	I	have	an	aunt	who	is	deep	into	witchcraft	and	spiritism.
She	used	to	have	all	of	us	kids	over	to	show	us	occult	“games.”	I	always	had	far
superior	abilities	with	the	ouiji	board,	tarot	cards,	etc.	As	I	reached	my	teens	I
realized	that	I	had	a	fast	growing	ability	to	influence	others,	to	make	them	do	as
I	wanted.	I	had	unusual	physical	strength	as	well.
I	remember	that	in	my	first	year	of	high	school	I	was	approached	by	a	lesbian
girl	who	tried	to	pull	some	of	her	tricks	on	me	after	gym	class	one	day.	I	went
into	an	uncontrollable	rage	and	nearly	drowned	her	in	a	toilet.	She	was	much
bigger	than	I,	but	I	would	have	killed	her	had	not	several	adults	intervened.
I	remained	in	the	same	school	throughout	high	school.	The	kids	there	made	fun
of	me	too.	The	worst	thing	in	the	world	at	that	age	is	to	have	your	own	peers
abuse	you	and	make	fun	of	you.	I	reached	the	point	where	I	couldn’t	cope	with	it
anymore.	When	I	was	in	the	12th	grade,	I	was	walking	down	the	hall	one	day
when	the	leading	player	of	the	football	team	called	out,	“Look	at	the	ugly	hairlip.”	I	remember	dropping	my	books	and	running	towards	him.	The	next	thing	I
remember	is	five	teachers	pulling	me	off	of	him.	I	had	nearly	beaten	him	to
death.	I	had	broken	his	nose,	jaw	and	a	number	of	the	bones	in	his	face.	I	had
unnatural	strength.	That	boy	weighed	close	to	two	hundred	pounds	and	I	only
weighed	ninty-eight	pounds	at	the	time.	I	didn’t	have	a	single	bruise	from	the
fight,	not	even	on	my	fists.

This	power	seemed	ominous	to	me	and	yet	I	enjoyed	it.	It	was	the	only	way	I
could	get	a	little	peace.	No	one	could	push	me	around.	I	look	back	on	it	with
heart	break	now,	but	at	the	time	it	seemed	worth	it	just	to	have	a	little	peace.	But
all	peace,	I	was	soon	to	find	out,	was	going	to	be	obliterated	by	a	lie	from	Satan
that	I	would	regret	for	a	long,	long	time	and	still	do.	I’m	thankful	that	Jesus
loved	me	all	that	time,	although	I	did	not	realize	it	then.	I	loved	the	power	that	I
had.	I	didn’t	know	where	it	was	coming	from,	but	I	wanted	to	find	out	how	to
get	more	of	it.	That	is	when	I	met	a	friend	named	Sandy	in	my	youth	group	at
church.	She	also	attended	the	same	high	school	as	I.	Sandy	was	seventeen	and	so
was	I.	Sandy	was	a	“recruiter”	for	the	satanist	cult	and	led	me	into	the	next	step
in	Satan’s	plan	for	my	life.

CHAPTER	3
Entering	The	Brotherhood

ELAINE	TALKS:
Sandy	became	a	friend	of	mine,	about	the	only	friend	I	had.	I	met	her	at	the
church	in	the	youth	group	I	mentioned	earlier.	I	didn’t	go	to	church	to	hear	about
the	Lord,	I	went	to	get	involved	with	the	other	kids.	Sandy	and	I	worked	together
on	various	youth	programs	in	the	church	and	at	high	school	we	also	chummed
around,	studied	together,	and	went	out	for	cokes.
Sandy	was	a	pretty	girl.	She	was	richer	than	I	was,	very	well	dressed	and	very
popular.	She	didn’t	seem	to	let	that	bother	her	too	much	where	I	was	concerned.
I	thought	she	was	my	friend	more	out	of	pity	than	anything,	but	that	was	because
I	didn’t	know	she	was	a	recruiter	for	The	Brotherhood.	Shortly	after	the	incident
with	the	football	player,	Sandy	mentioned	to	me	that	she	noticed	that	I	had	a
special	power	that	few	others	had.	She	said	she	knew	where	I	could	learn	to	have
more	of	that	same	power.
She	also	said,	“Hey	listen,	I	know	that	you’re	lonely	and	down,	and	I	think	I
have	something	that	can	help	you.	The	church	we’re	going	to	doesn’t	really	care
about	you,	and	God	doesn’t	really	care	about	you.	If	He	did,	you	wouldn’t	have
been	born	the	way	you	were.”	She	then	offered	me	a	chance	to	go	to	a	“youth
camp”	with	her	run	by	the	“group”	that	she	and	her	family	belonged	to.	She
called	it	a	“church	camp.”	It	was	located	in	a	small	town	a	few	miles	away.	It
was	held	during	the	summer.	School	was	out	at	the	time	and	as	I	had	nothing
else	to	do	I	decided	to	go.
I	told	my	parents	I	was	going	to	a	church	camp	—	they	really	didn’t	care	what	I
did.	I	was	fearful	and	yet	elated.	I	thought	that	I	had	finally	found	a	friend	and
that	maybe	this	was	the	answer	to	both	my	loneliness	and	my	questions	about	the
strange	power	inside	me.	Sandy	talked	to	me	about	the	camp	for	days	before	we
actually	went.	She	described	it	as	the	ideal	place	where	I	would	be	accepted	and
wanted	and	needed.	My	powers	were	needed,	she	told	me,	and	they	could	be
perfected.	I	would	be	able	to	become	great	and	famous,	or	rich,	whatever	I
wanted	I	could	have.	As	she	talked	I	felt	that	strange	power	within	me	beginning
to	stir	and	build.
What	Sandy	did	not	do	was	mention	the	word	“cult,”	or	tell	me	the	truth	about
this	group.	I	will	stop	here	and	give	you	a	capsule	summary	of	the	group.

This	group	which	secretly	calls	itself	The	Brotherhood,	is	made	up	of	people
who	are	directly	controlled	by,	and	worship,	Satan.	It	is	a	rapidly	growing	and
very	dangerous	cult.	It	has	two	major	centers	in	the	U.S.	—	the	West	coast,
mostly	in	the	Los	Angeles-San	Francisco	area,	and	another	in	the	mid-western
U.S.	where	I	lived.	They	are	divided	into	local	groups,	or	chapters,	called
covens.	The	covens	range	in	size	from	5-10	people	to	several	thousand.	This	is
the	same	cult	written	about	in	Hal	Lindsey’s	book,	Satan	Is	Alive	And	Well	On
Planet	Earth,	and	in	Mike	Warnke’s	book,	The	Satan	Seller.	It	is	also	the	U.S.
counterpart	of	the	group	in	England	written	about	in	the	book	Freed	From
Witchcraft,	by	Doreen	Irvine.
This	cult	is	extremely	secretive.	No	written	records	of	membership	are	kept.
Even	the	contracts	with	Satan	signed	in	blood	by	the	members	are	burned	by	the
high	priests	and	high	priestesses.	(This	is	not	common	knowledge	among	the
lower	ranking	members.)	These	satanists	infest	every	level	of	society	—	the	poor
and	the	rich.	The	very	well	educated,	the	police	force,	government	officials,
business	men	and	women,	and	even	some	so-called	Christian	ministers.	Most	all
of	them	attend	local	Christian	churches	and	are	considered	“good	citizens”
because	of	their	involvement	in	local	civic	activities.	This	is	all	done	as	a	coverup.	They	lead	double	lives	and	are	expert	at	it;	masters	of	deception.
“And	no	marvel;	for	Satan	himself	is	transformed	into	an	angel	of	light,
therefore	it	is	no	great	thing	if	his	ministers	also	be	transformed	as	the
ministers	of	righteousness...	”
II	Corinthians	11:14-15.
They	all	go	by	code	names	at	their	meetings	so	that,	should	they	meet	each	other
on	the	street,	often	as	not	they	would	not	know	each	other’s	real	name.	They	are
rigidly	disciplined	by	Satan	and	his	demons.	They	practice	human	sacrifice
several	times	a	year	and	animal	sacrifice	on	a	monthly	basis.	The	human
sacrifices	are	most	often	babies	—	born	out	of	wedlock	to	various	cult	members,
cared	for	by	the	doctors	and	nurses	within	the	cult	so	that	the	mother	is	never
seen	in	a	hospital	—	the	baby’s	birth	is	never	registered,	neither	it’s	death.	Other
sacrifices	are	kidnapped	victims,	a	cult	member	who	is	being	disciplined,	or	who
volunteers,	I	suspect	because	they	can	no	longer	live	with	themselves.	Many	of
them	are	cold	blooded	murderers,	extremely	skillful.
Each	coven	is	led	by	a	high	priest	and	a	high	priestess.	These	people	get	to	their
position	by	obtaining	favor	with	Satan	by	various	means	and	by	obtaining

position	by	obtaining	favor	with	Satan	by	various	means	and	by	obtaining
greater	and	greater	powers	of	witchcraft.	There	is	much	in-fighting	within	the
group.	There	is	an	elite	society	of	witches	within	the	cult	called	The	Sisters	of
Light.
There	are	several	occult	groups	in	the	U.S.	who	call	themselves	The	Illuminati,
most	are	not	a	part	of	The	Brotherhood.	There	is	a	group	called	the	Illuminati
made	up	mostly	of	people	who	are	directly	descended	from	the	Druids	of	ancient
England.	They	are	extremely	powerful	and	dangerous	people	and	are	linked	to
The	Brotherhood.	They	practice	human	sacrifice	frequently.
The	Sisters	of	Light	first	came	to	the	U.S.	from	Europe	in	the	late	1700’s.	They
date	back	to	the	dark	ages	in	Europe,	but	indeed	have	their	roots	back	to	the
sorcerers	of	ancient	Egypt	and	Babylon	who	were	powerful	enough	to	be	able	to
actually	reproduce	three	of	the	ten	plagues	sent	upon	Egypt	during	Moses’	time.
(See	Exodus	chapter	7.)	These	witches	are	incredibly	powerful.	They	are	able	to
produce	disease	and	kill	without	ever	physically	touching	the	victim,	even	over	a
distance	of	thousands	of	miles.	This	is	all	accomplished	by	demons	of	course,
and	these	people	are	deluded	into	thinking	that	they	control	the	demons	when
actually	Satan	and	the	demons	are	just	using	them.
Incredible	atrocities	are	committed	within	the	cult	by	humans	so	controlled	by
the	demons	within	them	that	they	lose	all	emotions	of	love	and	compassion	and
become	cruel	beings	that	hardly	seem	human.	Some	of	this	will	be	discussed
later	in	the	book.
The	rapidity	of	growth	of	The	Brotherhood	is	a	mark	of	the	end-times	we	are	in
and	a	direct	fulfillment	of	Biblical	prophecy.
In	the	United	States	and	around	the	world	there	are	countless	thousands	of	cults
and	groups	that	worship	and	serve	Satan	under	many	different	names.	Many	do
not	call	Satan	by	this	name,	but	by	some	other	name.	Many	simply	refer	to	him
as	the	“Master.”	Also,	there	are	many	independent	groups	of	self-styled	witches
and	satanists.	Customs	and	styles	of	worship	in	individual	groups	and
organizations	vary	widely.

I	stepped	directly	into	this	cult	when	I	went	to	that	summer	camp	with	Sandy.	I
was	very	excited	by	the	time	we	arrived.	With	excitement	you	lose	a	lot	of	what

you	see	and	hear.	We	were	taken	first	to	the	dorms	where	we	were	to	stay	and
made	to	feel	very	welcome.	The	camp	had	many	facilities:	museums,	libraries,
different	houses	where	you	could	go	to	clairvoyants,	hypnotists,	palm	readers,
tarot	card	readers,	voodoo	experts,	etc.	Some	of	these	people	lived	there	the	year
’round,	some	didn’t.	This	was	the	place	where	the	cult	officially	meets	with	the
unknowing	public.
We	attended	many	classes	which	taught	us	how	to	extend	and	use	our	“powers.”
Sandy	took	me	to	the	first	meeting	with	the	Sisters	of	Light.	Much	later	I	found
out	that	they	had	been	watching	me	carefully	throughout	my	childhood,	from	the
time	of	the	sale	of	my	blood	made	by	Helen	and	Grace.
Sandy	took	me	into	the	large	Satanic	church	on	the	grounds	about	two	hours
before	the	main	evening	meeting.	The	sun	was	setting	and	the	entire	church	was
dark	except	for	13	candles	in	a	circle	on	the	floor	at	the	front	of	the	church
which	cast	eerie	shadows	about	the	13	figures	also	seated	on	the	floor,	one
behind	each	candle.	As	we	drew	closer	I	could	see	that	the	figures	were	13
women,	all	dressed	identically	in	long	white	robes	with	attached	cowl-like	hoods
up	over	their	heads.	They	were	each	sitting	cross	legged	on	the	highly	polished
wooden	floor,	backs	straight,	arms	folded	across	their	breasts,	staring	with
absolute	concentration	into	the	candle	in	front	of	them.
The	candles	were	each	about	two	feet	tall	and	three	inches	in	diameter.	They
were	made	of	black	wax	and	each	one	sat	on	top	of	a	long	narrow	sheet	of	paper
that	was	covered	with	fine	writing.	The	wax	from	the	candles	dripped	down	onto
the	papers.	The	women	did	not	wear	jewelry	or	ornamentation	of	any	sort.	There
was	no	movement	by	any	of	them	except	for	their	continuous	low-voiced
chanting	and	humming	as	they	offered	their	prayers	to	Satan.	There	was	a	power
there	that	held	me	both	fascinated	and	awe	struck.	I	could	feel	a	mighty	stirring
of	the	unexplainable	power	within	myself	as	I	sat	and	watched	them	throughout
their	two	hour	ceremony.
I	found	myself	drawn	back	again	the	following	night	to	watch	the	same
ceremony.	I	knew	that	they	were	the	Sisters	of	Light	only	because	Sandy	told	me
so.	Other	cult	members	referred	to	them	as	“Mothers,”	and	few	knew	that	they
were	actually	this	elite	group.	They	never	told	men	of	their	identity	as	men	were
strictly	excluded	from	the	group.	However,	they	are	the	power-house	and	main
strength	of	the	cult,	and	a	strictly	guarded	secret	even	within	the	cult	itself.	They
do	not	tolerate	weakness	in	any	of	their	members,	anyone	weak	is	destroyed.
There	are	very	few	younger	women	among	them.
After	the	ceremony	the	second	night	I	was	approached	by	one	of	the	women.

After	the	ceremony	the	second	night	I	was	approached	by	one	of	the	women.
She	told	me	that	they	had	noticed	my	interest	and	already	knew	of	my	unusual
power,	and	that	they	would	very	much	like	for	me	to	enter	into	their	training
program.	They	were	casual	and	kindly	and	told	me	that	they	could	train	me	to
greatly	increase	and	extend	my	power	as	no	other	group	could.	I	swallowed	the
bait	hook,	line	and	sinker.
At	first	they	told	me	of	the	greatness	I	could	have,	of	how	I	could	use	the	power
within	me	to	get	what	I	needed,	also,	whatever	I	wanted	I	could	have.	This
power	was	of	Satan,	not	of	God.	They	were	the	first	to	tell	me	that	and	they	also
told	me	that	Satan	is	the	only	true	God.	They	taught	me	how	to	chant	and	hum.
Told	me	that	if	I	wanted	anything,	all	I	needed	to	do	was	to	light	my	candle	and
put	my	prayers	underneath	it.	Requests	not	only	for	myself,	of	course,	because	I
must	not	be	selfish.	I	could	pray	either	for	another	person’s	uplifting	or	for	his
downfall.	It	made	no	difference	as	long	as	there	was	someone	else’s	name	on	the
paper	as	well	as	my	own.
At	last	the	final	day	of	the	camp	came	and	I	prepared	to	go	home.	Suddenly	I
was	faced	with	the	fact	that	all	the	kindliness	of	the	people	at	the	camp	was	a
front	and	that	my	involvement	was	no	longer	a	game,	nor	was	it	voluntary.
When	I	met	Sandy	for	the	trip	home	she	told	me	that	she	had	just	had	word	from
the	Sisters	of	Light	that	they	were	offering	special	training	to	myself	and	some
others	who	were	“specially	gifted.”	Sandy	said	that	they	and	the	high	priest	and
high	priestess	wanted	to	speak	with	me	briefly	over	at	the	church	before	we	left.
I	went	over	to	the	church	and	entered	with	several	others.	After	we	got	into	the
church	we	saw	that	armed	guards	immediately	stepped	in	front	of	the	doors	and
we	were	told	to	stand	before	the	small	group	at	the	front	of	the	church.	The	high
priest	then	told	us	that	we	had	been	selected	to	join	The	Brotherhood,	which
meant	signing	a	contract	with	Satan	in	our	own	blood	at	a	meeting	the	following
night.	I	asked	what	was	in	the	contract	and	was	told	that	I	would	be	giving
myself	body	and	soul	and	spirit	to	“our	great	father	Satan”	in	return	for	many
“blessings”	from	him.	We	were	also	told	that	if	we	did	not	want	to	do	so	that
they	would	use	certain	“persuasion”	to	change	our	minds.	I	told	them	that	under
no	circumstances	would	I	sign	such	a	contract.	At	this	point	the	high	priestess
took	over	and	informed	me	that	I	had	no	choice.	I	looked	her	square	in	the	eye
and	said,	“Go	to	Hell!	You	bitch!	I	think	you	are	all	weird,	I	will	do	no	such
thing.”
Immediately	a	very	large	guard	armed	with	a	submachine	gun	came	up	behind
me	and	grabbed	my	arm	at	the	wrist	pulling	it	behind	me	and	upwards	with	such
force	that	I	felt	as	if	he	had	broken	it.	He	told	me	that	I	was	to	bow	my	knee	to

force	that	I	felt	as	if	he	had	broken	it.	He	told	me	that	I	was	to	bow	my	knee	to
the	high	priestess	and	ask	her	forgiveness	for	my	disrespect,	that	if	I	did	not	do
so	he	would	beat	me	until	I	did.	Outraged,	I	shouted,	“Then	go	ahead	and	start,
because	I’m	not	bowing	myself	to	any	woman!”
He	swung	at	me,	his	fist	catching	me	full	force	in	the	temple.	I	don’t	remember
anymore	until	I	awakened	in	small	5	X	5	foot	cell.	It	was	completely	bare	with	a
hard	wooden	floor.	The	door	had	a	small	window	out	to	a	hallway	so	that	I	could
be	observed.	It	was	almost	completely	dark.	I	was	in	that	room	for	24	hours.	It
seemed	like	days.	I	was	not	allowed	to	sleep,	speakers	blared	constantly.	I	was
told	over	and	over	again	that	all	glory	and	honor	and	homage	was	due	Satan.
That	I	needed	to	ask	Satan’s	forgiveness.	That	Satan	was	the	God	of	the
universe.	I	was	also	told	that	my	family	was	being	watched,	and	that	if	I	did	not
adhere	to	the	rules	and	regulations	and	sign	the	contract,	that	they	would	all	be
tortured	and	killed.	I	was	not	given	any	food	or	water	during	that	time.
The	following	evening	I	was	taken	from	the	room	by	two	guards	into	another
room	where	I	was	met	by	two	women	from	the	Sisters	of	Light.	They	helped	me
to	bathe,	then	placed	a	satiny	white	robe	over	my	nude	body.	My	feet	were	left
bare.	The	robe	reached	the	floor	and	was	tied	at	the	waist	with	a	white	cord.	It
had	a	cowl-like	hood	and	long	loose	sleeves.	It	did	not	have	ornamentation	of
any	kind.	The	women	told	me	that	I	should	not	fight	any	more,	that	I	could	not
avoid	my	destiny.	They	told	me	what	wonderful	“blessings”	I	would	receive	by
giving	myself	to	“my	father	Satan.”
I	was	transported	to	the	meeting	in	a	closed	van	so	that	I	could	not	see	where	we
were	going.	This	meeting	was	not	held	at	the	Satanic	church	on	the	camp
grounds.	I	caught	only	a	glimpse	of	the	outside	of	the	building	as	I	was	hurried
inside.	It	had	no	windows	and	was	back	in	a	woods.	It	looked	like	it	was	some
sort	of	storage	building	on	a	farm,	though	isolated,	and	there	was	some	straw	on
the	wooden	floor	inside.
The	building	was	dimly	lit	by	many	large	flickering	candles	around	the	walls.
The	candles	were	in	groups	of	three,	a	black,	red	and	white	candle	in	each	group.
There	were	200	to	300	people	present,	seated	on	plain	wooden	benches	facing
the	front	of	the	room.	At	the	front	was	a	wooden	platform	with	torches	burning
around	the	edge	on	about	5	foot	tall	poles.	There	was	a	rough-hewn	stone	altar
down	in	front	in	the	middle	of	the	platform	which	looked	like	it	was	sitting	on
saw	horses.	(I	was	to	learn	later	that	this	was	indeed	the	case	to	provide	easy
movability.)	The	stone	was	gray	with	many	brownish	stains	these	stains	were
from	the	blood	of	the	many	sacrifices	performed	on	that	altar,	both	animal	and
human.

human.
In	spite	of	my	exhaustion	and	fear	I	felt	a	stirring	of	excitement	as	I	felt	the
tremendous	invisible	power	within	that	room	and	a	responding	stirring	of	the
power	within	me.	Incense	was	burning,	filling	the	room	with	its	odor.	I	think	it
had	some	sort	of	drug	in	it	because	it	quickly	made	me	quite	dizzy.	The	room
was	absolutely	silent	as	the	robed	and	hooded	figures	looked	expectantly	at	the
empty	stage.	At	some	unseen	signal	many	small	hand-held	bells	started	ringing
as	the	high	priest	and	high	priestess	stepped	noiselessly	onto	the	stage	out	of	the
shadows.
The	high	priest	and	high	priestess	wore	identical	robes.	The	robes	were	both	of	a
black	satin	material,	the	same	style	as	my	own,	trimmed	with	red	around	the
hood,	down	the	front	edges	and	around	the	edges	of	the	long	full	sleeves.	Each
was	tied	at	the	waist	with	a	golden	cord.	Their	feet	were	also	bare	as	were
everyone	else’s.	Each	carried	a	scepter	about	3	feet	long.	The	high	priestess’	was
gold.	At	the	top	was	an	inverted	cross	with	a	serpent	curling	around	the	handle
and	up	onto	the	cross.	The	high	priest’s	scepter	was	of	the	same	design	but	made
of	silver.	The	scepters	were	carried	reverently	in	the	crook	of	their	arms.	Their
presence	was	commanding	and	I	became	aware	really	for	the	first	time	of	the
tremendous	power	they	had,	and	I	envied	them.
There	were	many	heavily	armed	guards	at	that	meeting	both	inside	and	outside
of	the	building.	This	was	my	first	attendance	of	a	real	cult	meeting.	All	the	rest
had	been	games	and	play	and	show.
After	the	opening	remarks	I	was	taken	forward	to	the	front	of	the	altar	by	the	two
guards.	I	and	the	others	were	introduced	to	the	congregation	as	new	members
“anxious”	to	join.	The	high	priest	first	centered	his	attention	on	me.	He	said,
“Brothers	and	Sisters	of	Satan,	we	bring	you	this	child,	this	one	called	Sister
Courage	(that	was	my	new	name).	We	bring	her	to	you	for	she	has	asked	to
become	one	of	us,	and	now	unto	our	lord	and	god	our	master,	the	master	of	the
universe,	and	also	the	destroyer,	Satan,	we	say:	this	child,	Sister	Courage,	we
give	unto	you	to	do	your	bidding	to	be	what	you	want	her	to	be.	We	have
promised	her	as	you	have	given	us	the	word	to	promise,	your	blessings.”
I	was	then	given	a	knife	to	cut	my	finger	with,	but	I	refused	to	do	so.	Instantly
one	of	the	guards	brought	a	whip	down	hard	on	my	back	causing	me	to	writhe	in
agony,	but	I	was	determined	not	to	bow	to	them.	With	a	flick	of	her	hand	the
high	priestess	signaled	the	guard	to	stop	beating	me.	She	spoke	in	a	voice
dripping	with	destain	and	said	that	there	were	much	more	effective	ways	of
showing	me	my	error.

I	watched	in	amazement	as	she	and	the	high	priest	took	up	positions	on	opposite
sides	of	a	large	pentagram	(five	pointed	star)	drawn	on	the	floor	in	the	middle	of
the	stage.	The	pentagram	was	drawn	inside	of	a	circle	and	a	black	candle	sat	at
each	point	of	the	star.	With	merely	a	wave	of	her	hand	the	high	priestess	lit	all
the	candles	at	once	without	touching	any	of	them.	Then	she	started	an
incantation,	the	high	priest	joining	in	with	the	chant.	The	audience	also	chanted
at	certain	points	when	directed	to	do	so	by	the	ringing	of	the	little	bells.
Suddenly	the	pentagram	was	engulfed	in	a	whoosh	of	smoke	and	blinding	light.
The	room	was	instantly	filled	with	a	foul	odor	as	of	burning	sulfur.	A	huge
demon	appeared	in	a	physical	manifestation	in	the	center	of	the	circle,	flames
surrounding	him.	He	was	huge,	about	8	feet	tall.	He	glowered	menacingly	at	me,
weaving	back	and	forth.	The	high	priestess	(Grace)	turned	to	me	and	told	me
that	if	I	did	not	obey	and	sign	the	contract	that	I	would	be	given	to	that	demon	to
torture	until	he	finally	killed	me.	That	was	enough	for	me!	Never	had	I	felt	such
fear,	but	at	the	same	time	I	lusted	after	the	power	displayed	by	Grace	(the	high
priestess).	I	was	determined	to	become	as	powerful	as	she	so	that	I	could	get
revenge	on	those	people	for	all	that	had	been	done	to	me.
When	I	signaled	my	willingness	to	sign	the	contract,	two	women	came	forward
and	placed	a	black	robe	over	my	white	one.	The	black	robe	was	made	of	a	cotton
material	and	was	of	the	same	design	as	the	white	one.	The	black	was	a	sign	that	I
was	no	longer	a	novice.	I	took	the	knife	offered	me	and	cut	my	finger	deeply.
Then	I	dipped	a	quill	pen	in	my	own	blood	and	signed	the	contract	with	my
name	stating	that	I	was	giving	myself	body,	soul	and	spirit	to	Satan.
Immediately	after	signing	the	contract,	I	was	engulfed	in	an	electronic	charge	of
energy	which	surged	from	the	top	of	my	head	down	to	my	toes.	It	was	so	strong
that	I	was	knocked	to	the	floor.	As	I	lay	on	the	floor	trying	to	recover	I	realized
that	Grace	was	doing	another	incantation.	I	struggled	to	my	feet	to	find	that	she
had	called	up	another	demon.	This	one	came	down	to	where	I	stood	and	told	me
that	he	was	going	to	live	in	me.	He	reached	out	and	roughly	grabbed	me	by	the
shoulders	before	I	had	time	to	say	anything.	Immediately	I	felt	agonizing,
searing	heat	go	through	my	body	and	smelled	sulfur	strongly	again.	In	the	midst
of	the	agony	I	passed	out	and	knew	nothing	more	until	I	was	roughly	loaded	into
the	van	for	the	return	trip	to	the	camp.	By	that	time	I	was	so	exhausted	and	dizzy
from	the	lack	of	sleep,	the	beatings	I	had	endured,	and	the	lack	of	food	and
water,	that	I	did	not	fully	comprehend	the	significance	of	what	was	happening	to
me.
I	stayed	at	the	camp	for	a	week	afterwards	so	that	the	most	noticeable	of	my	cuts
and	bruises	could	heal.	When	I	went	home	I	thought	and	felt	that	I	was	now	one

and	bruises	could	heal.	When	I	went	home	I	thought	and	felt	that	I	was	now	one
of	the	most	powerful	people	on	earth.	I	knew	that	I	had	power	that	was	beyond
most	peoples’	imagination.	I	thought	that	nothing	and	no	one	could	destroy	me.
How	wrong	I	was!

CHAPTER	4
Rise	To	Power

ELAINE	TALKS:
I	was	now	a	member	of	The	Brotherhood,	had	a	new	name	and	was	what	is
known	as	a	witch.	About	one	month	after	I	had	signed	the	contract	with	Satan	I
had	my	first	meeting	with	the	local	high	priestess.	The	coven	in	my	home	town
was	fairly	large,	about	a	thousand	people.	The	high	priestess	contacted	me	and
told	me	that	she	wanted	to	see	me	in	her	home.	I	was	very	surprised	to	be	called
by	such	a	high	authority.	Very	few	girls	are	ever	called	to	see	the	high	priestess
unless	they	are	to	be	punished,	or	if	she	has	something	specific	for	them	to	do.
Her	home	was	elaborate	and	very	beautiful	and	she	ruled	with	an	iron	hand.	She
told	me,	“You	have	been	specially	selected	by	Satan	to	be	trained	for	his	work
and	to	become	a	high	priestess	if	you	can	qualify.”
Within	the	satanist	cult	this	is	a	great	honor.	You	must	be	highly	ranked	to	be
accepted	for	that	type	of	training.	The	high	priestess	was	an	elderly	lady.	She
had	been	a	high	priestess	for	many	many	years.	She	was	very	pretty	even	though
she	was	old.	Her	personality	was	one	of	friendliness	and	yet	there	was	something
very	cold	about	her.	She	knew	that	I	was	to	replace	her.	A	high	priestess	is
always	destroyed	when	she	is	replaced	by	another	witch.	She	is	commanded	by
Satan	or	one	of	his	high	demons	to	train	another	witch	to	take	her	place.	She	has
no	choice	but	to	obey	the	command.
I	thought	it	strange	that	she	should	ask	me	to	be	trained	for	such	a	position	as	I
was	so	young	and	a	new	member.	What	I	didn’t	know	at	the	time	was	that	the
demons	that	I	already	had	were	far	stronger	than	hers	and	that	Satan	had
commanded	her	to	teach	me	exactly	what	they	were,	how	to	use	them,	and	how,
in	the	end,	to	destroy	her.
In	my	heart	of	hearts,	I	was	not,	and	never	would	be,	one	for	destruction.	I
enjoyed	living	and	I	did	not	want	to	hurt	this	lady,	but	I	knew	that	if	I	did	not,
she	would	kill	me.
I	received	intensive	training	in	several	areas	for	the	next	20	months.	I	met	with
the	high	priestess	mostly	at	her	home	or	at	other	meeting	places	where	we	met
off	in	another	room	away	from	the	other	members	of	the	cult.	We	met	often,	at
least	weekly.
The	contents	of	my	training	by	the	high	priestess	consisted	mainly	of
incantations.	I	learned	how	to	conjure	up	spirits	to	do	my	bidding.	She	taught	me
how	to	project	and	use	that	strange	power	that	I	had	felt	within	me	for	so	long.

how	to	project	and	use	that	strange	power	that	I	had	felt	within	me	for	so	long.
She	taught	me	that	those	powers	came	from	demons	dwelling	within	me.	She
also	taught	me	protocol	and	how	to	conduct	cult	meetings	as	a	high	priestess.
The	Sisters	of	Light	also	participated	in	my	training.	They	were	the	principal
ones	responsible	for	training	me	to	increase	in	power	as	rapidly	as	I	did.
Through	their	training	I	learned	many	secrets	that	most	other	high	priestesses
never	know.	They	asked	me	to	join	their	society	but	I	refused.	Secretly	I	always
thought	they	were	very	strange.
Arrangements	were	made	for	training	in	the	martial	arts	as	well.	I	already	knew
some	Karate	and	Judo,	but	knew	nothing	about	Kung-Fu.	I	was	given	into	the
hands	of	a	middle-aged	Chinese	man	who	was	a	master	of	all	three.	He	was	a
well	known	lawyer	in	my	home	town.	He	was	kind	to	me,	but	a	very	tough	taskmaster.	I	learned	much	from	him.	He	trained	many	cult	people	from	the	whole
surrounding	area.	He	thought	that	I	had	much	potential	and	wanted	me	to
participate	in	public	competition.	I	never	did	and	never	wanted	to.
Learning	the	martial	arts	was	a	rigorous	and	very	tormentive	type	of	training.	I
asked	special	demons	to	come	into	me	to	give	me	the	abilities	I	needed.	The
mind	and	the	body	must	be	trained	to	move	as	one.	I	could	jump	many	feet	in	the
air,	land	on	my	feet,	make	summersalts	and	come	up	and	destroy	someone	with
my	feet	and/or	hands.	I	became	expert	also	in	the	use	of	knives,	num-chucks,
swords,	guns,	bow	and	arrows,	stars	and	many	types	of	oriental	weapons	that	are
not	well	known	in	this	country.	Not	only	do	high	ranking	members	of	the	cult
receive	such	training,	but	a	number	of	the	lower	ranking	members	also	receive	it
so	that	they	can	serve	as	guards,	assassins,	etc.
I	was	taught	much	about	Satan,	almost	all	of	it	lies.	I	was	taught	about	his
power,	about	his	love	for	me.	How	I	had	been	rejected	by	God.	How	Satan	loved
me	and	wanted	me	as	his	own	and	about	how	I	had	been	chosen	among	all
women	to	be	his	high	priestess.	The	Sisters	of	Light	also	told	me	much	about	the
opportunity	to	become	a	regional	Bride	of	Satan.
There	are	only	5	to	10	regional	Brides	of	Satan	in	the	U.S.	at	any	one	time.	It	is	a
position	of	great	honor	and	power.	The	Sisters	of	Light	told	me	they	were	sure	I
had	the	ability	to	attain	this	high	position.	They	constantly	talked	about	all	the
benefits	I	would	gain	if	I	reached	it.	I	became	determined	to	gain	that	position.
The	first	demon	that	I	actually	saw,	manifested	to	me	in	a	physical	form	during
that	first	ceremony	when	I	signed	the	contract.	The	next	demon	I	actually	saw,
was	the	first	“conjured-up”	demon	of	my	own.	As	I	performed	the	appropriate
incantation	he	appeared	in	a	cloud	of	smoke	which	smelled	strongly	of	sulfur.

incantation	he	appeared	in	a	cloud	of	smoke	which	smelled	strongly	of	sulfur.
The	whole	episode	was	a	very	elaborate,	very	staged	type	of	thing,	but	he	was
very	real.	Again,	he	was	in	a	physical	form.
He	was	huge,	about	eight	feet	tall.	He	had	a	body	much	like	a	man,	yet	different.
He	was	all	black.	We	have	since	come	to	know	this	class	of	demons	as	Black
Warriors.	He	had	fiery	red	eyes,	huge	hands,	and	his	armor	was	really	his	skin.	It
was	made	up	of	thick,	black,	hard	scales,	something	like	a	tortoise’s	shell.	Each
scale	was	about	six	inches	square.	I	knew	that	this	was	a	powerful	demon	and	I
had	called	him	up	just	to	see	if	I	could	do	it.	As	he	stood	silently	staring	at	me,	I
told	him	that	I	was	the	“chosen	one.”	His	response	was,	“I	know	who	you	are,
and	I	know	that	I	am	sent	here	to	guard	you	and	that	nothing	will	ever	harm	you
as	long	as	I’m	here,	and	as	long	as	you	serve	the	almighty	Satan,	our	lord	and
our	god.”	His	name	was	Ri-Chan.	He	fought	many	battles	both	for	me,	and,
when	I	was	disobedient	to	Satan,	against	me.
I	saw	and	conversed	with	many	demons	after	that.	As	my	skill	grew	in	being
able	to	see	the	spirit	world,	I	was	able	to	see	and	talk	with	demons	without	them
taking	on	a	physical	form.	Indeed,	I	rarely	asked	them	to	appear	physically
except	on	occasions	when	I	wanted	to	impress	or	frighten	someone	lower	in	the
cult	than	myself.
The	next	major	demon	I	summoned	was	Mann-Chan.	This	was	during	one	of	my
training	sessions	with	the	high	priestess	in	her	home.	She	told	me	that	I	was	at	a
point	in	my	training	where	I	must	learn	and	do	a	very	special	incantation.	She
did	not	tell	me	the	purpose	of	the	incantation	and	I	did	not	ask.	I	knew	this	day
was	an	important	one	because	of	the	special	preparations	made.
First,	I	drew	on	the	floor	with	chalk	a	very	large	pentagram,	then	drew	a	circle
around	it.	(The	purpose	of	the	circle	around	the	pentagram	is	to	keep	the	demon
summoned	inside	the	circle	unless	you	gave	him	permission	to	move	out	of	it.
The	circle	is	supposed	to	protect	the	witch	from	the	demon	who	comes.	In
reality,	of	course,	the	demons	do	pretty	much	whatever	they	want	so	I	quickly
learned	to	be	very	careful	not	to	summon	a	demon	that	was	stronger	than	the
demons	I	had	protecting	me.)	Carefully,	I	placed	a	black	candle	in	each	corner	of
the	pentagram,	then	a	much	larger	black	candle	in	the	center.	All	six	were	lit.	A
table	with	a	hot	plate	on	it	was	set	up	close	to	the	side	of	the	pentagram.	The
contents	of	a	kettle	had	been	prepared	earlier	by	the	high	priest.	It	was	filled	with
desecrated	holy	water,	that	is,	holy	water	from	a	Catholic	church	which	the	high
priest	then	urinated	into.	He	had	also	taken	a	dog	and	killed	it	and	drained	its
blood	into	a	special	jar	which	he	had	given	to	me	to	take	to	the	high	priestess’
house.	She	then	gave	me	some	powders	and	herbs.	The	water	in	the	kettle	was

house.	She	then	gave	me	some	powders	and	herbs.	The	water	in	the	kettle	was
brought	to	the	boil	on	the	hot	plate	just	before	I	started	the	incantation.
I	asked	no	questions,	but	obeyed	the	high	priestess’	instructions	to	the	letter.	I	sat
on	the	floor,	staring	into	the	black	candle	in	the	center	of	the	pentagram,
murmuring:	“Oh	great	Satan,	the	power	and	builder	and	creator	of	the	universe,	I
beg	thee,	give	me	a	demon	to	be	the	guide	and	light	of	my	life	—	to	give	me	all
wisdom	and	knowledge.	My	beloved,	Oh	master,	grant	to	me	my	wish!”	At	that
point	the	high	priestess	spoke	the	name	Mann-Chan	to	me.
I	then	said,	“Mann-Chan	come,	you	are	welcome	into	my	body,	I	bid	thee	arise
from	your	hiding	place.”	I	took	the	powders	and	herbs	and	blood	and	cast	them
into	the	boiling	kettle.	The	steam	rose	and	immediately	the	room	was	filled	with
a	very	foul	odor.	I	then	dipped	a	desecrated	golden	goblet	into	the	kettle,	filling
it.	I	set	the	goblet	carefully	down	on	the	table	and	waited	expectantly.	Within
about	five	minutes	the	liquid	in	the	goblet	had	completely	turned	to	powder.
Then	I	took	the	goblet	and	threw	the	powder	from	it	into	the	flame	of	the	large
candle	in	the	center	of	the	pentagram.
Immediately	there	was	a	woosh	and	a	huge	flame.	The	candle	disappeared	in
blinding	white	light.	As	the	light	died	down	over	the	next	few	seconds,	I	could
see	the	figure	of	what	appeared	to	be	an	incredibly	handsome	young	man.	He
had	coal	black	hair	and	piercing	black	eyes	that	radiated	intelligence.	I	hurried	to
my	knees	beside	the	pentagram.	With	a	rag,	I	wiped	away	the	chalk	to	form	a
clear	pathway	through	the	pentagram.
The	young	man,	who	was	actually	the	demon	Mann-Chan	in	a	physical	form,
stepped	through	to	the	outside	of	the	pentagram	on	the	pathway	that	I	had	made.
He	spoke	to	me	in	perfect	English	in	a	gentle	manner	and	with	what	seemed	to
be	great	love.	He	told	me	that	I	was	to	be	inhabited	by	him	and	he	promised	that
no	harm	would	come	to	me.	He	told	me	that	he	would	give	me	all	wisdom	and
knowledge,	he	would	be	my	teacher	and	guide.	He	called	himself	my
“redeemer.”	I	agreed,	very	much	awed	by	his	beautiful	countenance.	He	then
walked	straight	into	me.	But,	in	the	instant	before	he	entered,	he	changed	from
the	human	form	to	the	demon	he	really	was.	HIDEOUS!
He	was	naked,	his	face	had	changed	from	beauty	to	hideous	cruelty.	The
beautiful	coal	black	locks	of	hair	had	become	dull	brown	and	were	coarse	and
sparse	and	stubby	like	pig	bristles.	His	eyes	were	incredibly	dark	and	evil,	his
mouth	open	to	show	long	sharp	dirty	yellow	fangs.	He	had	very	long	arms,	his
hands	had	stubby	fingers	tipped	with	long	sharply	pointed	nails.	He	uttered	a
horrible	hideous	loud	laugh	of	triumph	as	he	stepped	directly	into	my	body.	I

screamed	out.	First	at	the	sight	of	him,	then	at	the	pain	of	his	entrance.	Searing,
agonizing	pain,	such	as	I	had	never	before	experienced.	I	felt	as	if	my	body	was
on	fire.	I	felt	as	if	I	was	going	to	die	and	at	that	particular	moment	I	wished	with
all	my	heart	that	I	could	do	so.	Ri-Chan	stepped	forward	on	hearing	my	cry,
thinking	that	perhaps	I	was	being	attacked	from	without.	But	Mann-Chan	spoke
to	him	and	told	him	that	it	was	he	and	not	to	worry.	As	the	pain	died	down,
Mann-Chan	told	me	that	that	was	a	small	demonstration	of	what	I	would	get	if
ever	I	disobeyed	him	and	also	to	let	me	know	that	he	was	there	to	stay,	that
nothing,	and	no	one	could	ever	make	him	leave!
From	that	point	on	Mann-Chan	was	the	main	demon	in	my	life.	He
communicated	with	me	by	putting	thoughts	directly	into	my	mind.	I
communicated	with	him	either	by	speaking	aloud	or	by	speaking	with	my	spirit
body.	I	did	not	fully	realize	it	then,	but	Mann-Chan	could	not	actually	read	my
mind.	He	controlled	me	and	kept	all	my	doorways	open	to	Satan	and	the	other
demons	so	that	they	could	come	and	go	as	they	chose,	and	also	as	I	willed.	My
life	became	centered	around	him.	I	gave	all	of	my	time	and	effort	trying	to	gain
control	of	him,	but	he	had	more	control	of	me	than	I	did	of	him.	Often	he
knocked	me	unconscious	and	completely	controlled	my	body,	using	it	as	he
pleased,	frequently	speaking	through	my	mouth.	He	controlled	when	I	ate	and
slept,	how	well	I	did	my	work,	how	well	I	got	along	with	people	—	my	very	life
itself.
I	learned	through	him	how	to	use	demons,	how	to	use	them	in	spiritual	warfare.
How	to	use	them	to	strengthen	my	own	spirit	body,	how	to	use	them	in
ceremonies,	against-other	people,	other	witches,	churches	and	even	ministers	of
the	gospel	of	Jesus	Christ.	He	gave	me	the	ability	to	speak	many	languages	and
to	walk	and	talk	with	great	authority	and	power.
But	Mann-Chan	was	not	the	light	that	he	promised	or	the	thing	of	love	and
beauty	as	I	had	first	seen	him.	He	was	something	evil	and	rotten	and	was	eating
away	at	my	soul	and	body,	causing	me	much	suffering	and	much	pain	many
many	times	because	I	would	not	uphold	or	participate	in	human	sacrifices.	Life
was	a	continuous	nightmare	from	that	point	on.	I	was	living	a	double	existence.
That	is,	I	was	a	member	of	the	satanic	cult	and	also	simultaneously	a	member	of
a	very	large	Christian	church	where	I	taught	and	sang	and	participated	in	all	sorts
of	activities.	I	was	torn	constantly,	never	free	for	a	moment,	completely	trapped.
I	then	began	to	have	many	battles	with	many	witches.	Battling	is	done	in	several
ways.	The	most	common	is	for	the	stronger	witch	to	call	the	demons	out	of	the
weaker	witch	into	herself,	thus	making	her	even	stronger	and	often	resulting	in
the	destruction	of	the	weaker	because	she	no	longer	has	the	power	to	defend

the	destruction	of	the	weaker	because	she	no	longer	has	the	power	to	defend
herself.	Demons	have	no	loyalties.	They	will	always	go	to	the	stronger	person.
Satan’s	entire	kingdom	runs	on	the	principle	of	competition;	just	the	opposite	of
God’s	kingdom	where	everyone	serves	each	other.
Battling	is	rarely	if	ever	done	on	a	physical	plane,	although	witches	do	often	use
demons	to	destroy	the	physical	body	of	a	weaker	witch.	There	was	one	witch	in
particular	who	attacked	me.	Her	name	is	Sarah.	I	tried	to	explain	to	her	that	if
she	did	not	leave	me	alone	I	would	have	to	destroy	her.	She	did	not	believe	me
and	finally	we	entered	into	full	battle.	What	I	saw	was	absolutely	horrifying.	I
saw	her	grow	weaker	and	weaker	as	I	called	demon	after	demon	out	of	her	and
into	myself.	At	first	her	demons	fought	back	and	I	felt	my	own	body	being	lifted
up,	thrown	against	walls,	my	throat	being	strangled	without	the	sight	of	a
physical	hand.	But	what	she	saw	was	Mann-Chan	and	Ri-Chan	and	many	other
demons	coming	against	her.	They	were	tearing	her	body	apart.	She	finally
realized	that	I	was	truly	the	chosen	one,	that	I	was	to	be	the	high	priestess	and
that	she	had	lost	the	battle.
She	withdrew	in	time	to	live	and	I	thank	God	for	that.	She	ended	up	in	the
hospital	for	quite	some	time	as	a	result	of	the	injuries	she	sustained	in	the	battle.
Years	later	she	told	me	that	it	was	during	that	time	in	the	hospital	that	she
accepted	Jesus	as	her	Lord	and	Savior,	and	she	is	now	living	fully	and	wholeheartedly	for	the	Lord.	Believe	me,	the	change	is	beautiful.
My	first	meeting	with	Satan	came	shortly	before	the	ceremony	in	which	I
became	the	high	priestess.	He	came	to	me	in	the	physical	form	of	a	man	and	we
sat	down	and	talked.	He	told	me	that	I	was	to	be	his	high	priestess,	that	I	was
very	special	to	him.	He	told	me	also	that	there	had	to	be	a	sacrifice;	more	blood
had	to	be	shed	for	my	“purification”	so	that	I	could	become	his	high	priestess.	I
hated	that,	but	was	relieved	to	find	that	at	least	it	was	to	be	an	animal	sacrifice.
What	I	saw	was	a	man,	exceedingly	handsome,	very	bright	and	sunny	and
shining.	He	seemed	to	have	great	love	for	me	and	didn’t	seem	to	be	in	any	way	a
danger	to	me.	Mann-Chan	gave	no	indication	of	danger	and	neither	did	Ri-Chan.
I	was	very	much	awed	by	this	meeting.	I	wanted	him	to	come	back,	I	felt	a	need
deep	down	inside	for	him.	For	the	first	time	in	my	life	I	felt	really	loved.	How
wrong	I	was.	Satan	hated	my	guts.	He	wanted	only	to	use	me	for	his	own	benefit
and	then	planned	to	destroy	me.
I	attended	cult	meetings	very	regularly	during	my	2	years	of	training.	The
meetings	were	held	in	barns,	churches,	houses,	lodges,	all	different	places.	On
the	occasions	when	Satan	was	personally	present,	I	was	drawn	more	and	more	to

the	occasions	when	Satan	was	personally	present,	I	was	drawn	more	and	more	to
him	like	a	moth	is	attracted	to	a	flame.	He	knew	very	well	that	he	had	me
trapped.
Just	before	becoming	a	high	priestess	I	saw	a	human	sacrifice	for	the	first	time.
We	were	in	an	old	barn	with	at	least	a	thousand	people	present.	A	small	baby
was	used.	She	was	selected	because	her	mother	gave	the	child	to	be	sacrificed
and	thought	it	to	be	a	great	honor.	The	law	never	hears	of	these	babies	because
most	of	them	are	illegitimate,	they	are	born	at	home,	the	mother	never	sees
anyone	for	prenatal	care	and	no	record	of	the	baby’s	birth,	or	death,	is	ever
made.
The	baby	was	strapped	down	on	a	stone	alter	which	was	in	the	shape	of	an
upside-down	cross.	I	will	never	forget	the	awful	sound	of	her	screams	as	the
high	priest	drove	a	sharp	knife	into	her	chest	and	ripped	out	her	living	heart.	Her
blood	was	then	drained	off	and	drank	first	by	the	high	priest	and	high	priestess,
then	by	other	members	who	wished	to	do	so.	Many	did,	not	only	to	receive	new
and	stronger	demons,	but	also	because	it	is	believed	that	such	sacrifices	provide
increased	fertility	and	that	the	children	conceived	under	such	circumstances
would	be	strong	and	intelligent	and	powerful	in	Satanism.
I	could	not	get	away.	I	was	trapped	within	the	crowd.	I	was	filled	with	horror.	I
was	filled	with	emptiness	and	coldness	and	despair.	I	wondered	why	Satan
wanted	such	a	sacrifice.	Wasn’t	Christ’s	blood	enough?	We	were	constantly
being	told	about	Christ’s	defeat	on	the	cross	and	that	He	had	been	the	ultimate
sacrifice	to	Satan.	But	I	was	to	learn	that	Satan’s	desire	for	blood	and	destruction
is	insatiable.
My	last	and	final	battle	with	the	high	priestess	was	conducted	with	the	direct
approval	of	Satan.	It	took	place	at	a	big	meeting	in	the	church	where	I	had	first
met	the	Sisters	of	Light.	Satan	was	there	and	with	a	single	nod	gave	me
permission	to	take	her	on.	She	and	I	battled	back	and	forth.	She	was	very	old	and
the	battle	was	short,	lasting	only	about	20	minutes.	I	did	not	kill	her.	I	could	not
do	that	because	I	hold	life	very,	very	dearly.	She	quit	as	soon	as	she	saw	that	she
had	become	too	weak	to	fight	any	longer.	The	following	year	she	committed
suicide.
Then	came	the	ceremony	of	my	becoming	the	high	priestess.	A	blood	sacrifice
was	made,	then	I	was	taken	to	the	front	of	the	room,	or	church.	There	were
many,	many	people	present	because	it	was	a	very	high	ceremony	and	Satan
himself	was	present.	I	was	dressed	in	a	robe	of	white	with	gold	and	red
trimming.	I	had	a	crown	put	upon	my	head	made	of	pure	gold.	I	then	signed
another	contract	in	my	own	blood	declaring	myself	a	high	priestess	of	Satan.	No

another	contract	in	my	own	blood	declaring	myself	a	high	priestess	of	Satan.	No
one	in	the	room	made	a	sound	as	I	signed	that	paper.	Then	the	high	priest,	at	a
nod	from	Satan,	rose	to	declare	that	I	was	now	the	new	high	priestess.	He
proclaimed	that	I	was	to	be	untouched	by	anyone	else	in	the	cult,	by	any	demon,
high	priest,	witch,	or	high	priestess	of	any	other	coven,	for	I	was	“the	chosen
one.”	The	crowd	became	ecstatic,	shouting,	chanting	and	dancing.	Satan	himself
appeared	to	be	overjoyed.	Again,	he	was	in	a	physical	form	of	a	very	handsome
man,	a	man	of	great	brilliance	and	great	authority.	He	was	dressed	all	in	shining
white.
The	congregation	bowed	down	before	me	and	praised	me	as	the	great	queen,	as
the	queen	of	Satan,	“lord	god	almighty,”	that	I	was	and	would	forever	be	by	his
side	and	be	able	to	convey	to	them	his	every	wish	and	command.	I	felt	as	if,	for
the	first	time	in	my	life,	I	had	been	truly	accepted.	I	felt	very	proud,	very	much
uplifted,	and	very,	very	powerful	to	the	point	that	I	thought	that	no	one,
including	Satan	himself,	could	destroy	me.
I	was	then	put	upon	the	altar	of	stone,	my	clothes	were	all	taken	off	and	Satan
had	sex	with	me	to	prove	that	I	was	his	high	priestess.	(The	high	priest	and	many
others	had	sex	with	me	also.)	The	congregation	went	wild.	Many	of	them	were
high	on	drugs	and	alcohol	and	the	meeting	turned	into	a	sex	orgy.	Then	Satan
gave	the	most	hideous	laugh	of	triumph	I	have	ever	heard	in	my	entire	life.	My
body	became	cold	and	rigid.	I	remember	feeling	such	guilt,	such	pain,	such	hurt.
The	cold	and	emptiness	that	I	felt	that	night	I	will	never	forget.
“And	it	came	to	pass,	when	men	began	to	multiply	on	the	face	of	the
earth,	and	daughters	were	born	unto	them,	that	the	sons	of	God	saw	the
daughters	of	men	that	they	were	fair;	and	they	took	them	wives	of	all
which	they	chose	...	There	were	giants	in	the	earth	in	those	days;	and	also
after	that,	when	the	sons	of	God	came	in	unto	the	daughters	of	men,	and
they	bare	children	to	them	.	.	.	”	Genesis	6:1.	2.	&	4.

CHAPTER	5
Life	As	A	High	Priestess

ELAINE	TALKS:
As	I	assumed	my	duties	as	the	high	priestess	of	a	large	and	influential	coven,	I
had	many	privileges	and	many	conflicts.	I	came	into	conflict	with	Satan	and
many	of	the	other	cult	members	because	there	were	many	things	I	flatly	refused
to	do	or	get	involved	with.
My	major	responsibility	was	to	work	with	the	high	priest	of	the	organization	to
plan	the	monthly	cult	meetings.	Our	organizational	meetings	were	held	in	utmost
secrecy	and	usually	occurred	a	couple	of	times	a	month.	The	high	priest	and
myself	met	together	with	the	top	13	witches	and	13	warlocks	of	the	coven.	We
sat	in	a	council.	The	meetings	were	usually	held	in	a	large	and	rich	home	with
facilities	for	a	very	large	table	to	seat	all	of	us.	The	high	priest	and	myself	sat	at
the	head	of	the	table	with	the	13	witches	on	one	side	and	the	warlocks	on	the
other	side	in	the	order	of	their	rank.	Satan	usually	saw	to	it	that	there	were	also	a
few	of	what	we	viewed	as	undesirables	there	as	well.	These	people	were	known
werewolves	and	were	always	withdrawn,	always	watchful	and	always	menacing.
They	were	there	as	humans	and	did	not	turn	into	their	other	forms	unless	Satan
so	ordered	and	then	usually	only	for	disciplinary	purposes.	We	did	not	touch
them	or	talk	to	them.	They	belonged	to	Satan	exclusively,	they	were	totally	sold
out	to	him	and	were	feared	and	disliked	by	everyone	else	in	the	cult.	They	were
primarily	guards	and	disciplinarians,	used	by	Satan	and	his	demons	to	ensure
that	the	rest	of	us	obeyed	all	orders.
The	council	planned	the	meetings	and	took	care	of	the	business	of	the	coven.
Orders	from	Satan	were	given	to	the	high	priest	and/or	high	priestess	either
directly,	or	through	their	demons.	We	always	tried	to	plan	dramatic,	exciting
meetings	—	always	making	sure	that	there	would	be	plenty	of	drugs	and	alcohol
available.	I	did	not	purchase	the	drugs	or	alcohol,	I	had	nothing	to	do	with	that
kind	of	traffic.	That	was	left	up	to	the	cult	members	who	were	already	into	that
sort	of	thing.	There	was	never	a	shortage	of	such	people.	I	did	not,	and	would
not,	get	involved	with	it.	The	higher	members	of	the	cult	are	always	very	careful
not	to	get	mixed	up	in	anything	that	could	involve	them	with	the	law,	neither
does	any	high	member	ever	take	drugs	or	drink	alcohol	to	excess.	They	don’t
dare	cloud	their	minds	because	there	are	just	too	many	other	people	who	want
their	positions.
We	also	met	with	the	higher	representatives	of	other	occult	groups	in	the	area.
Many	satanic	groups	exist	which	are	not	part	of	The	Brotherhood	and	do	not

Many	satanic	groups	exist	which	are	not	part	of	The	Brotherhood	and	do	not
even	know	about	The	Brotherhood.	These	groups	are	carefully	watched	by	and
controlled	by	The	Brotherhood,	however.
One	of	the	duties	I	absolutely	refused	to	perform	was	sacrifices,	either	animal	or
human.	There	was	no	shortage	of	others	willing	to	perform	the	sacrifices,
however.	Because	of	my	stubbornness,	I	was	severely	punished	by	Satan	and	the
demons	on	many	occasions.	The	other	cult	members	could	not	get	to	me	as	I	had
too	much	power	by	then,	so	Satan	and	his	demons	did	the	punishing.	Usually	it
was	through	physical	punishment.	I	have	been	tortured	beyond	description	by
demons	many	times.	I	have	had	many	illnesses,	including	cancer	four	times	with
all	the	horrors	of	chemotherapy.	But	I	refused	to	give	in	on	this	issue.	I	simply
could	not	take	another	person’s	life.
Young	people	please	listen	to	me	—	ANY	involvement	in	the	occult	is	a	trap!
There	is	no	easy	way	out.	Satan	can	do	to	you	the	same	things	he	did	to	me	and
worse.	I	pray	daily	that	God	will	somehow	show	those	of	you	who	are	so	trapped
that	you	can	get	out.	Satan	doesn’t	have	you	even	though	you	have	signed	the
contract.	That	contract	can	be	covered	by	the	blood	of	Jesus	Christ.	You	can	be
freed	from	that	contract	if	you	ask	Jesus	into	your	life	to	forgive	you,	wash	you
clean	from	all	your	sins,	to	become	your	Lord	and	Savior	and	Master.	Satan	is
always	working	for	your	destruction,	Jesus	wants	to	give	you	life.
There	were	some	meetings	that	I	did	enjoy.	Sometimes	we	got	together	just	to
talk	and	play	games,	competing	with	our	powers	to	do	things	such	as	lighting	a
candle	from	across	the	room	without	ever	touching	it,	etc.	I	also	made	numerous
trips	out	to	California	for	competitions	and	conventions.	These	I	usually	enjoyed
very	much.
I	flew	in	a	private	jet	from	a	private	airstrip	near	to	the	town	where	I	first	entered
the	cult.	No	one	outside	the	cult,	and	few	inside,	know	its	location.	It	is	well
hidden	and	heavily	guarded.	I	was	usually	picked	up	by	the	high	priest	and	a	few
of	the	higher	witches	and	warlocks.	It	was	always	a	big	occasion.	The	purpose
was	to	exchange	ideas	and	to	compete	to	see	who	was	most	powerful.	It	was
through	these	competitions	that	I	rose	in	power	to	sit	on	the	national	council,	to
the	position	of	regional	Bride	of	Satan,	and,	finally,	to	the	position	of	top	Bride
of	Satan	within	the	United	States.
The	average	stay	was	a	week	and	the	conferences	were	usually	held	just	before	a
Black	Sabbath	when	the	Black	Mass	was	celebrated	(Easter	weekend).	I	always
found	an	excuse	to	return	home	before	the	Black	Mass.	We	went	to	a	special
place	in	the	hills	of	California	just	outside	Los	Angeles.	There	is	a	huge	mansion

there	which	was	built	especially	for	the	cult.	I	suppose	it	has	thirty	or	more
bedrooms.	It	has	many	beautiful	stained	glass	windows	specially	made	with
patterns	of	occult	and	demonic	symbols.	The	inside	is	lavishly	and	beautifully
furnished.	It	contains	a	huge	banquet	room	with	an	attached	ballroom.	And,	of
course,	swimming	pools,	tennis	courts,	golf	course,	etc.	It	looks	like	a
millionaires’	country	club.	It	has	3	sub-basements	with	huge	vaults	containing
libraries	of	ancient	occultic	writings	and	histories.	Vaults	also	containing	gold
and	silver	and	currency	from	all	the	countries	of	the	world.	The	entire	area	is
hidden	by	a	forest	of	trees	and	heavily	guarded	both	on	the	ground	and	in	the	air.
My	last	trip	there	involved	the	most	intense	competition	I	ever	experienced.	I
was	by	then	the	top	Bride	in	the	country.	It	was	an	international	competition.
The	leading	man	there	was	a	high	priest	who	was	different	from	the	others	who
had	been	there.	He	was	a	tall,	darkly	handsome	young	man,	but	there	was	a
foreboding	power	about	him	that	made	him	feared	and	disliked	by	everyone.	He
ran	the	competition	and	obviously	did	not	care	if	anyone	got	killed	if	he	or	she
failed	to	do	what	was	asked.	He	had	snapping	black	eyes	that	could	chill	you	to
the	bone.	He	ruled	with	an	iron	hand	and	even	I	did	my	best	to	steer	clear	of	him.
The	competition	consisted	of	increasingly	difficult	tasks	designed	to	display	the
contestant’s	power.	I	remember	that,	at	one	point,	I	had	to,	with	no	more	than	a
snap	of	my	fingers,	change	a	cat	into	a	rabbit	and	then	back	again.	The	actual
physical	changes	in	the	animal	were	accomplished	by	demons	and	resulted	in	the
animal’s	immediate	death.	By	the	last	day	I	was	the	only	competitor	left,	but	still
the	high	priest	kept	pushing	me.	I	had	no	choice	but	to	comply	with	his	wishes.
The	last	incident	would	have	killed	me	had	my	demons	not	been	powerful
enough.
I	was	made	to	stand	no	more	than	20	feet	in	front	of	a	man	with	a	.357	magnum.
I	passed	my	hand	downward	in	front	of	my	body,	calling	up	the	demons	and
placing	them	as	a	shield.	Immediately	the	gunman	fired	the	six	shots	of	the	gun
chamber	at	me.	There	was	no	way	he	could	miss.	The	demons	were	a	successful
shield,	needless	to	say,	and	the	bullets	fell	to	the	ground	at	my	feet	spinning
around	and	around.	I	received	much	acclaim	and	honor	for	winning	the
competition.
A	crown	of	gold	was	placed	upon	my	head	and	my	fellow	cult	members	bowed
down	and	gave	homage	to	me.	I	was	treated	like	a	queen	throughout	the	rest	of
my	stay.	I	was	given	all	the	beautiful	clothes	to	wear	that	I	could	possibly	want,	I
was	bathed,	my	hair	fixed	and	waited	on	hand	and	foot	by	servants.	There	were
parties	and	I	always	had	a	handsome	escort	who	was	also	my	bodyguard.	We
went	to	the	most	exclusive	restaurants	in	Los	Angeles.	My	escort	always	tasted

went	to	the	most	exclusive	restaurants	in	Los	Angeles.	My	escort	always	tasted
all	of	my	food	before	I	ate	to	make	sure	that	it	wasn’t	poisoned.	We	went	surfing
and	horseback	riding.	The	members	were	not	permitted	to	fight	among
themselves	during	that	time	because	it	was	considered	a	great	and	high	time	of
praising	Satan.	I	had	great	pride	at	that	time,	but	the	Lord	soon	humbled	me.
It	was	during	that	last	visit	to	California	that	one	of	the	incidents	happened	that
started	me	on	the	road	to	accepting	Christ,	started	me	questioning	Satan’s	claim
to	being	more	powerful	than	God.	The	high	priest	gathered	a	number	of	us
together	and	told	us	that	there	was	a	family	nearby	who	had	been	interfering
with	Satan.	They	had	been	converting	a	number	of	the	cult	members	to	the
enemy,	Jesus	Christ,	and	were	making	a	nuisance	of	themselves.	Satan	had	given
the	order	for	them	all	to	be	killed.	The	high	priest	told	us	that	we	were	all	to	go
together	in	our	spirit	bodies	(astral	project),	and	kill	them.	So,	we	sat	down	in	a
circle	with	our	candles	in	front	of	us	and	consciously	left	our	bodies	going	in	our
spirits	to	the	house	to	destroy	these	people.	I	was	not	at	all	enthusiastic	about	the
project,	but	had	no	choice.	If	I	had	disobeyed	I	would	have	been	killed.
Much	to	our	surprise,	as	we	arrived	at	the	edge	of	this	family’s	property,	we
could	go	no	further.	The	whole	area	was	surrounded	by	huge	angels.	The	angels
stood	side	by	side	holding	hands.	They	were	dressed	in	long	white	robes	and
stood	so	close	together	that	their	shoulders	touched.	They	had	no	armor	or
weapons.	Nobody	could	get	through	them,	no	matter	how	we	tried.	Any	kind	of
weapon	used	merely	bounced	off	of	them	doing	them	no	harm.	They	laughed	at
us	at	first,	daring	us	to	come	ahead	and	try	to	get	through	them.	The	other	cult
members	got	more	and	more	furious	with	each	passing	moment.	Suddenly	their
countenances	changed	and	the	fierce	look	from	their	eyes	made	all	of	us	fall
backwards	onto	the	ground.	A	very	humbling	experience,	I	might	add!
I	will	never	forget	—	as	I	sat	on	the	ground	looking	up	at	them,	one	of	the	angels
looked	directly	into	my	eyes	and	said	to	me	in	the	most	loving	voice	I	had	ever
heard,	“Won’t	you	please	accept	Jesus	as	your	Lord?	If	you	pursue	the	course
you	are	taking	you	will	be	destroyed.	Satan	really	hates	you,	but	Jesus	loves	you
so	much	that	He	died	for	you.	Please	consider	turning	your	life	over	to	Jesus.”
That	was	the	end	of	the	battle	for	me.	I	refused	to	try	any	longer	to	get	through.	I
was	very	shaken.	The	others	tried	for	awhile	longer,	but	none	succeeded.	I	doubt
the	family	ever	knew	of	the	battle	going	on	outside	their	house.	They	were
completely	protected!	We	called	this	particular	type	of	special	angels	“link
angels.”	Absolutely	nothing	can	get	through	them.	I	was	secretly	thankful	that
we	did	not	get	through	and	the	link	angels	had	given	me	much	to	think	about.
In	spite	of	that	experience	with	the	angels	it	was	a	couple	of	years	before	I

In	spite	of	that	experience	with	the	angels	it	was	a	couple	of	years	before	I
turned	to	the	Lord	Jesus.	I	still	was	lusting	after	more	and	more	power,	refusing
to	face	the	fact	that	power	was	destroying	me	and	condemning	my	soul	to	an
eternity	in	Hell.

CHAPTER	6
The	Wedding

ELAINE	TALKS:
I	had	many	privileges	as	a	high	priestess	and	I	greatly	benefitted	from	these	in
my	day-to-day	life,	but	I	continued	to	thirst	for	ever	greater	power.	A	few	years
after	becoming	a	high	priestess	I	reached	my	goal	of	becoming	a	regional	bride
of	Satan.	Many	high	priestesses	call	themselves	brides	of	Satan,	and	in	a	sense
they	are,	but	Satan	also	has	a	very	few	chosen	women	that	become	his	brides	in
a	much	more	exclusive	manner.	Only	five	to	ten,	and	usually	only	five,	exist	in
the	United	States	at	one	time.	This	position	is	the	highest	and	most	“honorable”
position	to	which	a	woman	can	attain	within	Satanism.	One	woman	is	picked	by
Satan	from	a	large	region	of	the	country.	That	woman	is	considered	the	most
powerful	and	respected	and	loved	in	the	whole	area.	These	women	also	sit	on	the
national	council	which	runs	all	the	satanists	in	this	country	and	has	also	much
power	internationally	because	of	the	great	wealth	in	the	U.S.
Satan	himself	came	to	me	to	tell	me	that	he	had	selected	me	for	this	great	honor.
He	presented	himself	to	me	in	the	physical	form	of	a	man,	very	handsome,	in
fact,	the	exact	image	of	what	I	held	in	my	mind	as	being	the	“perfect”	man.	He
told	me	that	he	had	selected	me	because	he	loved	me	above	all	the	others,	and
that	he	both	liked	and	respected	my	courage	and	abilities.	He	behaved	in	a	very
loving	and	romantic	manner,	telling	me	of	his	love	and	of	the	wonderful	times
we	would	have	together.	He	also	promised	to	give	me	much	greater	power	and
many	special	privileges.
I	was	honored	and	excited,	mostly	excited	because	I	hoped	that	at	last	I	was	truly
loved.	I	thought	that	I	was	the	most	powerful	and	honored	of	all	women.	I
thought	that	Satan	had	picked	me	because	of	my	abilities	and	my	love	for	him
which	had	grown	stronger	and	stronger	year	after	year.	I	did	not,	at	that	time,	see
that	Satan	was	merely	using	my	love	for	him	to	benefit	himself.	He	used	me	to
get	other	people	to	do	what	he	wanted	and	used	my	love	for	him	for	my	own
destruction.	All	his	declarations	of	his	love	for	me	were	lies!
The	ceremony	was	held	in	a	large	city	nearby.	One	of	the	city’s	largest	and	most
beautiful	churches	was	rented	by	the	cult	for	the	occasion.	I	am	sure	that	the
owners	of	the	church	had	no	idea	what	their	church	was	being	rented	for.	I	had
arranged	to	have	a	3-day	weekend	off	from	work.	The	ceremony	took	place	on	a
Friday	night,	the	first	night	of	the	full	moon.	I	was	carefully	guarded	and	my
every	wish	attended	to.	I	was	so	very	excited	and	elated!

As	my	companions	and	I	approached	the	church	I	was	briefly	impressed	with	a
feeling	of	a	heavy	darkness	hanging	over	the	church,	but	I	shrugged	the	feeling
aside,	turning	my	thoughts	to	the	love	and	admiration	I	held	for	Satan.
I	was	taken	to	a	room	away	from	the	sanctuary	at	the	church	and	carefully
prepared	and	dressed	for	the	occasion.	At	the	time	my	hair	was	long,	blond	and
curly.	The	women	fixed	my	hair	with	live	flowers	which	they	wove	into	it.	I	was
dressed	in	a	white,	long-flowing	robe-type	gown	with	gold	braid	criss-crossing
my	chest.	There	was	a	splotch	of	red	over	my	heart	and	pubic	area.	I	had	a
crown	of	pure	gold	placed	on	my	head.	I	carried	a	bouquet	made	up	of	grasses,
thistles	and	poisonous	berries,	all	tied	with	a	black	ribbon.
As	I	stood	just	outside	the	sanctuary	peeping	in,	I	was	surprised	and	greatly
honored	to	see	that	not	only	were	there	many	people	there	from	the	surrounding
states	and	California,	but	also	a	number	of	older	members	of	the	cult	from	the
Eastern	world.	This	was	indeed	a	great	honor.	The	sanctuary	was	filled	with
eerie	music	from	the	large	pipe	organ.	Satan’s	golden	throne	had	been
transported	to	the	church	and	set	up	on	the	platform	at	the	front.	The	signal	to
start	the	ceremony	was	Satan’s	sudden	appearance	in	physical	form	on	the
throne.
Again	he	appeared	as	a	man,	dressed	completely	in	white,	wearing	a	crown	of
gold	with	many	jewels	in	it.	The	whole	congregation	stood	with	a	shout	and
much	worship	was	given	to	Satan.	Then,	at	a	sign	from	Satan,	all	heads	turned	to
the	back	and	I	started	forward	down	the	aisle.	I	was	escorted	by	the	high	priest,
followed	by	the	Sisters	of	Light.	When	I	reached	the	end	of	the	aisle	I	stopped
before	Satan’s	throne	and	bowed	down	before	him	and	did	him	homage.	Then	he
gave	me	the	command	to	rise.	As	I	did	so,	he	arose	from	his	throne	and	came
down	to	stand	beside	me.	The	high	priest	performed	the	wedding	ceremony.
Most	of	the	ceremony	was	singing,	chanting	and	proclaiming	the	praises	of
Satan.	The	Sisters	of	Light	stood	in	a	semicircle	behind	us	and	chanted	and
hummed	quietly	throughout	the	ceremony.
The	ceremony	took	almost	two	hours,	I	stood	the	whole	time.	I	again	signed	a
contract	with	my	own	blood.	Then	I	was	given	a	liquid	to	drink	from	a	golden
goblet.	I	do	not	know	what	was	in	the	liquid,	but	I	suppose	there	were	some
drugs	in	it,	as	I	felt	rather	light-headed	after	drinking	it.	It	certainly	destroyed	the
clarity	of	my	mind.	I	was	told	that	the	contract	was	binding.	There	was
absolutely	no	way	to	get	out	of	it.	Satan	doesn’t	believe	in	divorce!
Satan	himself	did	not	give	any	of	his	blood,	neither	did	he	drink	any	of	the
potion.	He	told	me	that	he	could	not	as	he	“must	keep	himself	pure”	for	me.	But

potion.	He	told	me	that	he	could	not	as	he	“must	keep	himself	pure”	for	me.	But
that	I	must	drink	in	order	to	purify	myself	for	him.	He	was	the	most	beautiful	I
had	ever	seen	him.	He	wore	what	looked	like	a	pure	white	tuxedo,	decorated
with	gold.	His	hair	was,	on	this	occasion,	shining	gold	and	his	skin	bronzed	as
with	a	beautiful	tan.	His	eyes	were	dark	and	the	love	he	professed	for	me	and	the
smiles	he	gave	to	me	never	seemed	to	reach	his	eyes.	But,	I	wanted	to	believe
that	he	really	did	love	me,	and	that	he	was	really	my	husband.	He	treated	me
with	the	greatest	of	respect.	He	caressed	my	cheek,	my	hair,	my	arms.	He	told
me	how	I	looked	to	him:	great	beauty,	great	power	and	that	I	could	become	what
he	had	really	always	hoped	for	the	mother	of	his	son,	“The	Christ”	the	redeemer
of	the	world.	I	was	completely	taken	in	by	his	deception.
Satan	gave	me	a	beautiful	broad	gold	wedding	band	with	an	inscription	inside	it
which	said:	“Behold	the	bride	of	the	Prince	of	the	world.
Although	Satan	showed	no	hostility	towards	me,	he	did	towards	others.	Anyone
moving	towards	him	to	touch	him	or	to	bow	down	to	him	was	kicked,	or	beaten
and	driven	away.
Immediately	after	the	ceremony	I	was	taken	by	the	Sisters	of	Light	and	changed
into	an	exquisite	gown	and	given	a	cape	of	velvet	trimmed	with	pure	gold.	We
were	then	taken	by	limousine	to	the	airport	where	we	boarded	a	luxurious
private	jet	along	with	several	high	priests	and	high	priestesses	and	flown	out	to
California.	The	wedding	supper	was	served	aboard	the	jet	on	the	way.
Satan	did	not	eat	any	food,	but	he	did	sip	at	several	of	the	very	expensive	wines
and	champagnes	available.	He	had	very	little	to	say.	By	the	time	we	arrived	at
the	mansion	in	the	hills	of	California,	I	was	pretty	hazy	from	the	drugs	I	had
been	given.	We	were	escorted	with	much	pomp	and	ceremony	to	a	large	suite	of
rooms.	The	bed	chamber	had	a	large	golden	bed	in	it.	Afterwards	I	was	thankful
for	the	drugs	I	had	been	given,	because	once	we	were	alone	Satan’s	beautiful
appearance	disappeared	and	the	sexual	intercourse	we	had	was	brutal.	Satan	was
gone	by	the	time	I	awoke	the	next	day.	I	was	in	agony	with	many	wounds	from
the	night.	I	was	thankful	that	he	did	not	reappear	again	that	weekend.	I	was
flown	home	on	Sunday.	While	I	was	there,	I	was	treated	like	royalty.	I	was
waited	on	hand	and	foot	and	given	anything	I	wanted.
I	received	many	advantages	with	my	new	position.	I	held	absolute	power	over	all
the	witches	and	warlocks	and	even	the	high	priest.	I	was	untouchable.	I	gained
more	power	and	new	demons.	Only	one	witch	was	foolish	enough	to	try	to	take
me	on.	With	merely	one	look,	I	pushed	her	into	the	wall.	Literally	into	the	wall
itself	so	that	she	had	to	be	cut	out.	She	sustained	many	broken	bones	and	other
injuries	as	a	result.	She	never	again	tried	to	harm	me	and	neither	did	any	other

injuries	as	a	result.	She	never	again	tried	to	harm	me	and	neither	did	any	other
human.
I	rapidly	rose	to	the	position	of	the	top	bride	and	my	responsibilities	grew	also.	I
became	one	of	Satan’s	representatives.	I	made	many	trips	within	the	U.S.	and	to
other	countries.	My	trips	were	for	the	purpose	of	helping	to	coordinate	Satan’s
programs	with	satanists	in	other	lands.	I	saw	very	large	sums	of	money	change
hands,	and	the	involvement	of	many	government	officials.	All	of	my	trips	were
“off	the	records”	in	private	jets.	Most	powerful	and	wealthy	organizations	serve
Satan.	The	“little”	people	of	the	organizations	do	not	know	this,	but	those	at	the
top	know.
I	was	completely	deceived	by	Satan.	He	lies	to	ALL	of	his	servants.	I	thought	I
was	the	most	powerful	and	knew	everything	about	his	organization.	After	I	got
out	I	realized	that	Satan	doesn’t	tell	any	of	his	servants	the	truth	about	his
activities	or	his	organizations.	Everyone	of	any	position	in	Satan’s	kingdom	is
told	that	he	or	she	is	the	greatest	and	most	powerful.	All	of	it	is	lies!
It	was	during	this	time	that	I	met	many	of	the	well	known	Rock	music	stars.
They	all	signed	contracts	with	Satan	in	return	for	fame	and	fortune.	The
evolution	of	Rock	music	in	the	U.S.	was	carefully	planned	by	Satan	and	carried
out	by	his	servants	step	by	step.
Despite	my	high	position	and	great	power,	I	lived	in	constant	fear.	I	had	to	live	a
completely	double	life.	I	lived	on	welfare	part	of	the	time	because	I	was	so	afraid
others	would	realize	what	I	was	involved	in.	I	made	up	all	sorts	of	excuses	for
the	times	I	was	away	on	trips.	I	was	careful	that	my	family	and	friends	had	no
idea	what	I	was	doing.	I	wanted	to	enjoy	the	benefits	of	lots	of	money,	but	was
too	afraid	to	do	so.	I	was	continually	given	empty	promises	of	riches	“later	in
life.”	Satan’s	promises	are	rarely	fulfilled.	I	had	no	peace	and	I	felt	very	trapped.
My	greatest	problem	was	with	the	incredible	evil	perpetuated	within	the	cult.
The	brutal	discipline	and	above	all	human	sacrifice!

CHAPTER	7
Discipline	Within	The	Brotherhood

ELAINE	TALKS:
Sex	for	the	others	in	the	cult	was	free	and	easy	and	just	about	all	the	time.	Also
sex	with	children.	A	very	high	percentage	of	all	children	within	the	cult	are
regularly	sexually	molested	from	a	very	young	age.	The	cult	members	mostly
pair	off	with	others	of	the	same	power	level.	Almost	every	ceremony	or	meeting
ends	with	a	sex	orgy.	Individual	members	usually	have	the	right	to	participate	in
sex	if	they	want	to.
There	was	sexual	intercourse	with	demons	also.	Demons	that	could	be	seen	and
heard	and	felt	in	a	physical	manifestation.	This	would	occur	usually	at	meetings
and	sabbaths	where	a	lot	of	drugs	were	used.	Demons	also	had	sex	with
unwilling	people.	People	who	were	being	punished	for	not	doing	what	Satan
and/or	the	demons	wanted	done.	Often	a	man	was	forced	to	watch	while	more
than	one	demon	had	brutal	sexual	intercourse	with	his	wife.	That	was	a	very
effective	way	of	discipline.
Fear	is	a	tactic	that	is	used	more	often	than	anything	else.	Fear	of	death,	fear	of
having	your	family	tortured	in	front	of	your	eyes.	Both	humans	and	demons
were	tortured.	Many	times	demons	were	forced	to	physically	manifest,	then	they
were	tortured	and	torn	into	pieces	by	other	stronger	demons	because	of	some
minor	disobedience.	The	sights	and	sounds	of	these	hideous	episodes	were
burned	into	the	minds	of	everyone	present.	The	group	was	then	told	that	this	was
an	example	of	what	would	happen	to	them	if	they	dared	to	disobey	Satan	or	the
demons.
During	many	ceremonies,	especially	the	“high”	ceremonies	in	which	human
sacrifices	were	performed,	demons	often	took	on	physical	human	forms.	At
times	it	was	difficult	to	tell	who	was	a	demon	and	who	was	a	human.	However
demon	eyes	are	cold	and	lifeless,	their	touch	is	like	burning	coals	and	yet	there
seems	to	be	no	life	in	them.
Torture	of	loved	ones,	especially	children,	is	also	a	favorite	tactic	to	ensure
absolute	obedience.	Parents	are	forced	to	stand	and	watch	as	their	children	are
beaten	to	death,	brutally	sexually	molested,	or	stripped	of	their	skin.	If	the	child
survives,	the	parents	cannot	take	him/her	to	a	hospital	because	they	would	be
thrown	into	jail	for	child	abuse.	They	could	never	prove	they	had	not	done	the
torture	to	the	child	—	there	would	always	be	other	satanists	who	would	step
forward	to	testify	that	they	had	seen	the	parents	abusing	the	child.	The	doctors

within	the	cult	will	not	care	for	them	either	unless	the	parents	can	afford	to	pay
exorbitant	sums	of	money.
Another	favorite	method	of	discipline	is	sacrifice.	Always	there	is	a	time	of
breathless	horror	and	fear	just	before	each	human	sacrifice	as	every	member	of
the	congregation	waits	to	see	just	who	will	be	sacrificed.	Many	of	the	sacrifices
are	people	who	have	been	disobedient,	or	who	have	tried	to	pull	out	of	the	cult.
Werwolves,	zombies,	vampires	and	other	wer	animals	do	exist.	I	have	seen
many	of	them.	This	is	a	very	closely	guarded	secret	by	Satan.	No	one	controls
these	beings	except	Satan	or	his	high-ranking	demons.	He	uses	them	mostly	for
discipline.	I	will	never	forget	one	incident	during	a	meeting	when	Satan	sent	a
werwolf	after	a	man.	The	man	jumped	up	and	ran	with	the	snarling	werwolf	after
him.	He	could	not	hope	to	outrun	the	animal-human.	He	realized	this	and	turned
and	pulled	a	.357	magnum,	firing	the	contents	of	the	chamber	directly	into	the
werwolf.	The	werwolf	never	even	faltered.	He	tore	the	man	to	shreds.	No	one	in
the	congregation	dared	move	or	make	a	sound,	fearing	that	the	werwolf	would
be	turned	on	them	next.
These	creatures	are	human	beings	possessed	by	certain	types	of	powerful
demons	capable	of	bringing	about	the	necessary	physical	changes	within	the
human	body.	Some	of	the	ancient	Christian	writings	from	the	dark	ages	about
these	wer	animals	in	Europe	are	very	accurate.	I	have	never	found	anything	in
writing	that	is	accurate	about	them	except	in	the	ancient	Satanic	writings	kept	in
the	vaults	of	the	main	Satanic	mansion	in	the	hills	of	California.	The	wer
animals	are	greatly	feared	and	hated	by	everyone	within	the	cult.	They	are
loners,	100%	sold	out	to	Satan.	I	suspect	that	during	the	Tribulation	period	they
will	greatly	increase	in	number	and	be	openly	used	by	Satan	for	discipline.
Another	frequent	method	of	discipline	is	demonically	inflicted	illness.	Also
accidents,	loss	of	job,	etc.	Demonic	illnesses	usually	are	a	favorite	because	few
doctors	can	diagnose	what	is	wrong	and	the	person	so	afflicted	dies	a	very
painful	and	slow	death	while	doctors	think	he	is	imagining	the	symptoms.
Most	of	the	children	born	to	parents	in	the	cult	are	dedicated	to	Satan,	much	like
the	baby	dedications	in	the	Christian	churches.	The	ceremony	involves	a
“baptism”	of	the	infant	in	the	blood	of	a	sacrificed	animal.	These	children	are
demon	possessed	from	before	birth.	This	goes	on	for	generation	after	generation
unless	some	parents	are	willing	to	let	Jesus	Christ	become	the	Lord	and	Master
of	their	life,	and	let	His	blood	wash	away	all	that	sin.
The	blood	of	Jesus	is	so	powerful,	and	His	work	on	the	cross	so	complete,	that
even	the	werwolves	can	be	saved	if	they	want	to	be.	Jesus	can	raise	the	dead

even	the	werwolves	can	be	saved	if	they	want	to	be.	Jesus	can	raise	the	dead
today	just	as	he	did	when	he	walked	the	earth	in	a	human	body.	These	people
under	Satan’s	control	are	dead.	I	praise	God	that	today	I	am	completely
delivered,	I	belong	to	Jesus,	to	Him	alone,	and	there	is	no	way	that	Satan	or	any
of	his	people,	no	matter	what	they	do	to	me,	can	stop	me	from	telling	what	is
going	on	in	Satan’s	kingdom.
You,	reader,	if	you	are	a	member	of	The	Brotherhood,	you,	too	can	be	delivered
from	this	bondage.	You	don’t	have	to	stay	in	Satan’s	kingdom	of	evil	and
darkness	and	fear.	Jesus	can	and	will	set	you	free.	All	you	need	to	do	is	ask	Him
to	wash	away	your	sins	with	His	blood,	and	become	your	Lord	and	Master.
Don’t	wait,	time	is	very	short.	Jesus	is	coming	back	soon.	There	are	not	many
days	left.	Make	haste	while	there	is	yet	time.	Will	you	be	left	behind	when	Jesus
comes	and	takes	home	all	of	His	own?	Please	turn	to	Him	now	!

CHAPTER	8
The	Black	Mass	and	Human	Sacrifice

ELAINE	TALKS:
Human	sacrifice	is	a	subject	that	few,	if	any,	ex-cult	members	are	willing	to	talk
about	because	of	the	legal	implications.	I	am	doing	so	only	at	the	Lord’s
command.	It	is	a	fact	and	a	practice	of	The	Brotherhood.	I	have	spent	most	of
my	life	in	hospitals	and	operating	rooms	because	of	my	persistent	refusal	to	bow
to	Satan	in	this	area.	I	flatly	refused	to	participate	in	human	sacrifice.
Because	of	my	extremely	rapid	rise	in	power	I	quickly	attained	a	position	in
which	I	could	determine	what	I	would	and	would	not	do.	That	is,	as	far	as	other
humans	were	concerned.	I	was	more	powerful	than	the	other	satanists	so	they
could	not	touch	me.	Satan	and	his	demons	could,	however.	I	have	been	brutally
disciplined	and	tortured	by	demons	on	many	many	occasions	because	of	my
refusal	to	obey	Satan	in	this	area.	I	have	had	cancer	4	times	with	many	surgeries
and	all	the	horrors	of	chemotherapy.	The	cancer	was	directly	given	to	me	by
Satan	as	punishment	for	my	refusal	to	participate	in	human	sacrifice.	I	have	no
doubt	that	I	would	probably	have	been	killed	shortly	if	the	Lord	had	not	had
mercy	on	me	and	saved	me	out	of	Satan’s	captivity	when	He	did.
The	customs	and	ceremonies	involved	in	human	and	animal	sacrifice	differ
somewhat	in	different	areas.	Also,	in	recent	years,	especially	on	the	West	Coast,
large	numbers	of	young	people	are	becoming	involved	in	Satanism	through
Rock	music,	occultic	role-playing	fantasy	games	and,	of	course,	by	much
individual	recruitment.	These	independent	groups	are	usually	heavily	involved	in
drugs,	are	very	open,	careless	and	blatant	in	what	they	do,	and	are	not	directly
involved	with	The	Brotherhood.	Many	of	them	do	not	even	know	the	group
exists.	These	are	the	groups	careless	enough	to	get	caught	in	their	various	crimes
of	ritulistic	child	abuse,	human	sacrifice,	etc.	At	the	time	I	left	Satanism,	there
was	a	growing	concern	among	the	leaders	of	The	Brotherhood	about	the
carelessness	of	these	people.	However,	Satan	is	rapidly	becoming	so	bold	that	he
really	doesn’t	care	and	he	certainly	doesn’t	care	how	many	of	these	people	end
up	in	jail	for	the	crimes	they	commit.	Satan	knows	he	doesn’t	have	many	years
left	and	he	is	rapidly	moving	to	perpetuate	as	much	destruction	upon	this	earth	as
possible.
In	the	United	States	there	are	eight	“holy	days”	out	of	each	year	when	human
sacrifice	is	usually	performed.	(Human	sacrifices	may	also	be	performed	on
other	days	for	other	reasons	such	as	discipline,	fertility	rites,	etc.)	Smaller
covens	who	do	not	have	the	necessary	facilities,	usually	join	with	the	larger

covens	who	do	not	have	the	necessary	facilities,	usually	join	with	the	larger
covens	nearby	on	these	occasions.	The	“holy	days”	are	Christmas,	Easter,
Halloween,	Thanksgiving,	and	as	close	as	possible	to	the	first	day	of	spring,
summer,	fall	and	winter.	(Satan	wishes	to	desecrate	each	of	God’s	mercifully
ordained	seasons.)
Halloween	has,	since	its	inception	by	the	Druids	in	England,	been	a	special
holiday	for	human	sacrifices	to	Satan.	It	continues	the	same	in	our	day.	The
sudden	epidemic	of	harmful	substances	and	objects	being	placed	in	the	various
Halloween	treats	for	“trick-or-treaters”	is	no	accident.	It	was	a	carefully	planned
effort	by	Satanists.	The	children	injured	and	killed	by	these	treats	are	sacrifices
to	Satan.
The	purpose	of	the	sacrifices	as	taught	to	cult	members,	is	to	“purify”	them	so
that	they	can	receive	Satan’s	“blessings.”	Also,	anyone	who	drinks	the	victim’s
blood	or	eats	their	flesh	gains	new	demons	and	therefore	greatly	increased
power.	The	drinking	of	blood	is	an	important	part	of	all	Satanic	activities.	This	is
no	accident,	Satan	constantly	strives	to	defile	all	of	God’s	principles.
“And	whatsoever	man	there	be	of	the	house	of
Israel,	or	of	the	strangers	that	sojourn	among
you,	that	eateth	any	manner	of	blood;	I	(God	is
speaking]	will	even	set	my	face	against	that	soul
that	eateth	blood,	and	will	cut	him	off	from
among	his	people.	For	the	life	of	the	flesh
is	in	the	blood	.	.	.	”	Leviticus	17:10-11.
Human	sacrifices,	as	with	all	cult	meetings,	are	never	held	the	same	place	twice.
Most	members	do	not	find	out	the	location	of	the	meeting	until	a	few	hours	prior
to	its	start.	Sacrifices	are	always	held	in	the	most	hidden	and	isolated	areas
possible.	In	large	cities	this	sometimes	becomes	a	problem,	but	there	are	usually
enough	vacant	or	abandoned	warehouses	and	buildings	available.	Rarely	does
The	Brotherhood	hold	a	human	sacrifice	outside	except	when	very	secluded	and
isolated	country	or	swampy	areas	are	available.	This	is	not	true	with	the	younger
bolder	people	tripped	out	on	drugs.	They	are	not	overly	concerned	with	security
and	because	of	this	The	Brotherhood	sees	to	it	that	many	of	them	are	discovered
by	the	police	and	arrested,	or	are	simply	exterminated	to	prevent	trouble.	They
are	always	declared	to	be	insane,	The	Brotherhood	sees	to	this	so	that	a	serious
connection	with	Satanism	is	not	made.

Specific	committees	are	appointed	and	maintained	within	The	Brotherhood	to	set
up	the	necessary	equipment	and	to	provide	clean-up	afterwards.	Satanists	who
are	also	policemen	are	almost	always	on	these	committees.	Their	function	is	to
prevent	any	interference	from	law	enforcement	agencies.	The	equipment,	such	as
the	altar,	in	large	cities	Satan’s	golden	throne,	etc.	is	transported	in	plain	vans.	It
can	be	quickly	set	up	and	taken	down.	The	bodies	are	almost	always	disposed	of
by	cremation.	Babies	are	rather	easily	ground	up	—	even	in	a	garbage	disposal,
and	are	often	disposed	of	in	this	manner.	Occasionally	the	body	is	cremated	at
the	site	of	the	sacrifice,	when	this	is	not	practicable	there	usually	is	no	difficulty
in	using	the	facilities	of	a	nearby	mortuary.	Also	crematory	facilities	at
veterinary	hospitals	or	animal	shelters	are	frequently	used.	The	highly
disciplined	and	carefully	planned	work	of	both	the	set-up	and	clean-up
committees	has	been	responsible	for	keeping	the	practice	of	human	sacrifice	out
of	the	public	eye	for	many	many	years.
Security	at	such	ceremonies	is	always	tight	and	police	radio	frequencies	are
continuously	monitored	throughout	the	ceremony.	Anyone	who	has	witnessed
such	a	ceremony	of	human	sacrifice	and	then	tries	to	pull	out	of	the	cult	does	so
at	the	cost	of	his	or	her	own	life.	The	only	way	to	get	out	is	through	the	power	of
Jesus	Christ	and	even	then	it	is	not	easy.	The	demons	closely	monitor	everyone
who	has	ever	been	even	slightly	involved	with	such	a	practice.
I	will	describe	here	a	Black	Sabbath	(also	called	the	Black	Mass)	that	I	was
forced	to	attend.	I	was,	at	the	time,	a	minor,	not	yet	a	high	priestess	and	was
literally	a	captive.	Black	Sabbaths	take	place	once	per	year.	Always	at	the	time
of	the	full	moon	and	on	the	Easter	weekend.	Most	of	the	competitions	that	I
attended	in	California	were	just	before	Easter	and	culminated	in	the	Easter	Black
Sabbath.	Regardless	of	the	cost	I	always	managed	to	get	away	just	before	the
ceremony.	Satan	saw	to	it	that	I	paid	dearly	for	that	rebellion,	but	I	didn’t	care.
I	was	very	young	at	the	time	of	that	horrible	weekend,	still	a	child	actually,	but
the	memories	of	it	torment	me	still	and	always	will.	I	had	been	a	member	of	the
cult	for	less	than	a	year.	I	was	informed	by	the	high	priestess	that	a	very
important	ceremony	was	coming	up,	that	I	was	“privileged”	to	be	“invited,”	but
she	also	made	it	very	clear	at	the	same	time	that	I	had	no	choice,	I	would	attend.
Only	those	who	are	invited	attend	and	those	invited	have	no	choice	but	to	attend.
Few	are	willing	to	incur	Satan’s	wrath	by	not	attending	because	they	are	afraid
that	if	they	did	so	they	would	be	likely	to	end	up	the	sacrificee	at	the	next	Black
Mass.	I	was	not	permitted	to	go	alone	but	was	taken	by	my	“master”	(the	high
priestess)	and	several	other	witches.
The	meeting	was	held	in	a	very	large	isolated	barn	which	had	been	roughly

The	meeting	was	held	in	a	very	large	isolated	barn	which	had	been	roughly
remodeled	for	the	purpose.	I	suppose	that	there	were	a	couple	thousand	people
there	from	the	whole	surrounding	area.	Most	had	already	been	taking	drugs	prior
to	coming	and	all	were	given	potions	to	drink	containing	drugs	and	alcohol	at	the
beginning	of	the	meeting.	I	always	avoided	taking	any	of	these	drugged	drinks
because	I	knew	the	danger	of	clouding	my	mind.	There	were	too	many	who
coveted	my	position	of	being	trained	to	be	a	high	priestess.	The	higher	members
of	the	cult	never	partook	of	these	drugged	drinks	and	despised	those	who	did	so.
I	didn’t	know	what	was	going	to	happen	as	I	entered	the	barn	with	my
companions	that	night.	It	was	a	Friday	night,	Good	Friday.	The	meeting	was	to
run	through	that	Sunday.	I	saw	that	the	barn	had	a	platform	across	one	end.
Above	the	platform	sat	a	throne	made	of	pure	gold.	That	throne	was	for	Satan.
This	was	obviously	an	important	occasion	if	Satan	was	to	put	in	a	personal
appearance.	I	was	to	learn	later	that	split	second	timing	of	such	sacrifices	is
required	by	Satan	and	absolute	coordination	between	covens	across	the	country
because	Satan	can	only	be	in	one	place	at	a	time.	The	timing	must	be	accurate	so
that	he	could	attend	every	meeting.	He	is	not	omnipresent	like	God.
As	the	high	priest	and	high	priestess	came	out	onto	the	platform	an	absolute
silence	fell	over	the	crowd.	A	silence	so	intense	that	you	could	hear	a	pin	drop.
The	silence	was	one	of	fear.	Each	one	was	afraid	that	he	or	she	might	be	chosen
to	be	the	sacrifice.	At	that	moment	Satan	was	no	longer	a	glory	to	anyone,	no
longer	an	honor.	A	ripple	of	relief	went	through	the	crowd	when	the	victim	was
dragged	kicking	and	screaming	through	a	side	door	and	up	onto	the	stage.	The
main	Easter	sacrifice	is	always	a	man.	Occasionally	additional	sacrifices	of
women,	children,	or	animals	are	made,	but	the	ceremony	centers	around	the
sacrifice	of	a	man.	Often	a	hitch	hiker	is	picked	up	some	days	before	the
ceremony	and	carefully	guarded	until	the	time	of	the	meeting.	In	the	eyes	of
Satan	and	the	crowd,	that	man	becomes	Jesus	and	Satan’s	supposed	victory	over
Jesus	at	the	cross	is	celebrated.
I	watched	in	utter	horror	as	a	crown	of	huge	long	thorns	was	driven	into	the
young	man’s	head.	The	thorns	going	in	so	deep	as	to	pierce	into	his	skull.	Then
he	was	stripped	and	beaten	with	whips	tipped	with	metal	studds,	and	tortured
with	spikes,	and	red-hot	pokers.	Finally	he	was	nailed	to	a	wooden	cross	which
was	then	picked	up	and	placed	in	a	hole	in	the	ground	just	in	front	of	the	middle
of	the	platform.	I	will	never	forget	the	stench	of	the	burned	and	tormented	flesh,
the	screams	of	the	victim,	his	writhing	agony,	his	pleas	for	mercy.	The	crowd
roared	like	a	pack	of	wild	animals,	the	inhuman	voices	of	many	demons	from
within	the	crowd	joining	in.	They	jeered	and	cheered	as	the	cross	was	raised	into

within	the	crowd	joining	in.	They	jeered	and	cheered	as	the	cross	was	raised	into
place	and	dropped	down	into	the	hole.	Satan	had	appeared	by	that	time	and	sat
on	his	throne	nodding	in	approval.	The	high	priest	urinated	on	the	victim	and
members	of	the	congregation	threw	feces	at	him	while	everybody	cheered
Satan’s	supposed	victory	and	then	bowed	down	and	worshiped	Satan.
Satan	appeared	in	human	form	as	usual,	dressed	completely	in	shining	white.
But	his	eyes	glowed	red	as	a	flame	and	he	threw	his	head	back	and	gave	a	howl
and	a	scream	and	a	hideous	laugh	of	victory	as	the	high	priest	drove	a	long	spike
through	the	man’s	head,	pinning	it	to	the	cross,	killing	him.	The	crowd	went
crazy,	screaming	and	shouting	and	dancing	in	crazed	ecstasy	at	the	“victory.”
They	loudly	proclaimed	all	victory	and	power	and	honor	to	their	father	Satan.
Satan	vanished	shortly	after	that	to	go	on	to	the	next	Black	Sabbath	sacrifice.
At	his	departure	the	meeting	turned	into	a	sex	orgy.	Human	with	human,	and
demon	with	human.	Every	type	of	sexual	perversion	imaginable	was	practiced.
The	victim’s	blood	was	drained	off	and	mixed	with	drugs	and	alcohol	and	drank
by	the	high	priest	and	high	priestess	and	passed	through	the	crowd.	Many	of	the
crowd	went	up	to	desecrate	the	body.	The	night	hours	passed	by	while	the
drugged	demonic	drunken	frenzy	of	the	crowd	continued.	Eventually	the	body
was	severed	from	the	head	and	ground	up,	and	portions	mixed	with	drugs	and
other	substances.	Those	who	wanted	more	power	ate	some	of	the	mixture.	The
third	day,	as	people	began	to	come	down	from	their	drugged	state,	they	left	for
home	in	two’s	and	three’s.	All	proclaiming	that	their	great	and	glorious	father
Satan	had	won	yet	another	victory	over	the	enemy	Jesus	Christ.
What	a	mockery	the	Black	Sabbaths	are!	Satan	knows	that	they	are	a	mockery!
The	ceremony	itself	is	supposed	to	be	symbolic	of	the	death	of	Christ.	Satan
proclaims	that	Jesus	Christ	was	the	ultimate	sacrifice	to	him,	that	he	won	over
Christ	by	killing	him	on	the	cross.	Satan	is	lying!	He	knows	that	he	was	defeated
at	the	cross,	not	Jesus,	and	so	do	all	of	the	demons.	But	the	people	don’t.	I	am
one	of	the	fortunate	ones,	I	found	out	that	it	is	all	a	lie.	It	is	all	an	indescribably
horrible	lie.	I	declare	to	you	the	reader,	you	who	are	yet	satanists,	you	who	have
not	yet	made	Jesus	your	Lord	and	Master,	SATAN	WAS	NOT	VICTORIOUS	AT
THE	CROSS!	God’s	word	sums	it	up	the	best:
“And	having	spoiled	principalities	and	powers,
he	made	a	shew	of	them	openly,	triumphing
over	them	in	it	[referring	to	Jesus’	death	on	the
cross].”
Colossians	2:15

Colossians	2:15
JESUS	IS	ALIVE!	Satan	has	no	right	to	any	of	us.	We	can	be	free	from
bondage	to	Satan.	All	we	need	do	is	ask	Jesus	to	set	us	free.	He	already	paid	the
price.	Won’t	you	ask	Jesus	today?	Tomorrow	may	be	too	late.

CHAPTER	9
Turning	Points

ELAINE	TALKS:
The	first	real	turning	point	in	my	life	came	about	a	year	after	I	became	the
regional	bride	of	Satan.	My	dream	world	of	believing	that	I	was	actually	loved
by	someone	—	Satan	himself	—	was	cruelly	shattered.
Apparently	I	had	committed	some	minor	offense	against	Satan,	so	minor	in	fact,
that	I	had	not	even	realized	that	I	had	done	anything.	I	was	home	alone	one	day
when	suddenly	four	huge	demons	appeared	in	a	physical	manifestation.	They
were	all	four	identical,	they	were	dark,	about	seven	feet	tall	and	covered	with
black	scales	similar	to	Ri-Chan.	They	had	vicious	faces,	long	fangs	and	even
longer	fingernails	that	were	like	razor	sharp	steel.
Without	any	warning	they	came	and	attacked	me.	They	clawed	me	with	their
long	nails,	shredding	my	flesh.	They	beat	me	and	tossed	me	back	and	forth	from
one	to	another	like	a	rubber	ball.	I	screamed	and	cried	and	begged	them	to	stop
hurting	me,	begged	them	to	tell	me	why	they	were	doing	this	but	they	never
answered	a	word.	They	just	snarled	and	laughed	hideous	laughs.	Mann-Chan	and
Ri-Chan,	my	guardians,	simply	stood	by	and	made	no	move	either	to	help	me	or
to	make	any	explanation	as	to	why	they	were	doing	this	to	me.	After	about	a	half
an	hour	they	left	as	suddenly	as	they	had	come.
I	was	left	lying	on	the	floor,	exhausted	and	in	agony.	My	back	was	torn	in
shreds,	I	had	huge	bruises	from	head	to	toe.	The	furniture	was	all	tossed	about
and	my	blood	was	everywhere.	As	I	lay	there	sobbing	and	panting	and	trying	to
recover	a	bit,	Satan	walked	through	the	closed	door.	As	usual	he	was	in	his
favorite	guise	of	an	extremely	handsome	young	man.	He	stood	looking	down	at
me	and	then	threw	back	his	head	and	laughed!	He	continued	to	laugh	as	I	lay
there	sobbing,	asking	him	why	the	demons	had	so	cruelly	tormented	me.	He
never	gave	me	any	answer	except	to	tell	me	that	I	was	being	disciplined.	He
went	on	to	add	that	he	thought	that	the	demons	had	done	a	rather	good	job	of	it.
Then,	without	making	any	move	to	help	me,	he	disappeared.
I	didn’t	have	any	answers	except	one,	Satan	hated	me	and	was	a	liar.	That
knowledge	was	a	wound	deeper	to	my	heart	than	any	wound	on	my	body.	I	was
left	to	clean	up	myself	and	the	apartment	as	best	I	could.	By	that	time,	I	was	a
nurse,	and	I	had	to	use	every	bit	of	my	nursing	skill	and	knowledge	just	to
survive.	I	could	not	go	to	anyone	for	help	as	I	could	not	explain	what	had
happened	to	me.	No	one	cared	enough	about	me	to	come	and	find	out	what	was
wrong	with	me	or	to	help	me.	When	finally	my	wounds	healed	there	was	no

wrong	with	me	or	to	help	me.	When	finally	my	wounds	healed	there	was	no
scarring.	Satan	saw	to	that.	He	left	no	evidence	that	I	could	possibly	use	against
him	in	the	future.
It	was	then	that	I	knew	beyond	a	shadow	of	a	doubt	that	Satan	hated	and
despised	me	and	did	not	love	me	as	he	said	he	did.	I	also	realized	that	the
demons,	too,	were	using	me	for	their	own	ends.	It	was	Mann-Chan	and	the	other
demons	that	had	told	on	me	for	whatever	small	thing	I	had	done.	Many	times	I
had	covered	for	them	about	something	they	had	done	in	order	to	protect	them
from	Satan’s	wrath.	They	had	betrayed	me!
It	was	then	that	I	decided	to	get	out	of	the	cult	if	possible,	although	it	was	a
couple	of	years	before	God	showed	me	the	way.	I	felt	overwhelmingly	trapped.
Demons	were	all	around	me	and	within	me.	At	that	time	I	also	thought	that	they
could	read	my	mind.	I	dared	hardly	think	about	wanting	out	and	certainly	could
never	speak	about	it	or	the	demons	would	know.	I	did	not	know	where	to	turn
for	help.	Where	in	the	world	could	I	ever	find	the	power	to	overcome	Satan	and
his	demons,	supposing	I	even	survived	long	enough	to	try?	I	had	to	pretend
continually	that	I	was	still	willing	to	be	within	the	cult.	I	knew	that	ultimately
Satan	and	the	demons	planned	my	destruction.	If	Mann-Chan	or	any	of	the	other
demons	found	out	what	I	was	thinking	it	would	have	meant	death	and	an
agonizing	death	at	that.
Two	years	after	that	episode	of	discipline,	a	lady	I	worked	with	started	inviting
me	to	go	with	her	to	her	church.	I	continuously	refused.	I	had	troubles	enough
without	going	with	that	“fanatic.”	Then	Satan	came	to	me	again	as	the	handsome
young	man.	He	put	his	arms	around	me,	acted	very	loving	and	told	me	that	he,
my	husband,	had	been	terribly	insulted,	and	that	only	I	could	get	revenge	for
him.
He	knew	of	Esther’s	(the	lady	at	work)	invitations	to	go	with	her	to	her	church.
He	wanted	me	to	go	and	destroy	that	church	because	the	people	there	were
daring	to	proclaim	that	he,	Satan,	not	only	was	alive	and	well	but	that	he	was
evil	and	should	and	could	be	fought	against.	I	was	to	go	and	join	the	church	and
then	split	it	and	destroy	it.	He	wanted	me	to	use	the	eight-part	plan	that	his
servants	(including	myself)	had	used	and	are	using	so	successfully	all	over	the
world	to	destroy	Christian	churches.	(These	8	points	will	be	discussed	in	detail
in	Chapter	17.)
I	tried	twice	to	go.	The	first	time	I	couldn’t	even	get	out	of	the	car	because	the
power	of	God	was	there	so	strongly.	I	had	never	experienced	such	a	thing	before.
The	second	time	I	made	it	to	the	door,	but	literally	could	not	take	hold	of	the

The	second	time	I	made	it	to	the	door,	but	literally	could	not	take	hold	of	the
door	knob.	Again,	the	power	and	presence	of	the	Lord	was	too	strong.	The
demons	within	me	felt	it	as	well	and	flatly	refused	to	go	in.	I	don’t	know	if	I
would	ever	have	gone	in	if	Esther	hadn’t	approached	me	again	at	work.	She
dared	me	to	go!	Esther	knew	me	well	enough	by	then	to	know	that	I	would	never
turn	down	a	dare.
So	finally	I	went,	slipping	in	on	the	back	row.	Esther	was	watching	for	me	and
when	she	saw	me	come	in	she	motioned	for	me	to	go	up	to	the	front	and	join	her
but	I	refused.	So	she	came	back	and	sat	with	me,	telling	me	that	“It’s	O.K.,	God
is	here	on	the	back	row	just	as	much	as	on	the	front	row!”	I	did	not	appreciate
that	at	all!
It	so	happened	that	the	young	man	preaching	there	that	night	was	applying	for
the	position	of	pastor.	It	was	all	I	and	the	demons	could	do	to	sit	through	his
sermon	and	I	was	a	hardened	church	goer.	Then,	to	make	matters	worse,
immediately	after	church	he	made	a	bee-line	to	the	back	row	where	Esther	and	I
sat	and	talked	to	me	and	tried	to	get	me	to	give	my	life	to	Jesus.	I	told	him	in	no
uncertain	terms	that	I	did	not	want	or	need	Jesus.	He	just	smiled	then	and	said,
“Well	I’m	sure	that	you	won’t	mind	if	I	pray	for	you.”	Remembering	in	the	nick
of	time	that	I	was	supposed	to	join	the	church,	I	managed	to	stifle	my	initial
response	and	muttered	“No,	I	don’t	mind.”
Then,	much	to	my	horror,	he	put	his	hand	on	my	shoulder	and	proceeded	to	pray
for	me	right	there	out	loud!	I	could-n’	t	stand	to	be	touched	by	anyone,
especially	him,	neither	could	the	demons!	I	squirmed,	but	that	didn’t	seem	to
register	with	him,	he	just	went	on	praying.	I	scrambled	out	of	the	church	as
quickly	as	I	could	after	he	finished.	But	something	had	touched	me.	On	the	way
home,	I	told	the	Lord	that	if	He	did	exist	and	wanted	me	to	be	His,	that	He	must
let	that	young	man	become	the	pastor	of	that	church.	The	following	Sunday	the
church	voted	to	make	him	the	pastor.	It	was	almost	a	year	before	I	kept	my	side
of	the	bargain.
During	that	year	another	incident	happened	that	also	was	very	key	in	making	me
realize	that	Satan	was	lying,	that	there	is	a	power	greater	than	his	and	that	Jesus
must	be	the	answer.	Shortly	after	I	had	started	going	to	the	little	church,	Satan
came	to	me,	obviously	very	angry.	He	told	me	that	there	was	a	“young	smartalec	doctor”	at	his	“special”	hospital	in	a	nearby	city.	This	doctor	was	not	only
greatly	interfering	by	“preaching	and	praying	everywhere,”	but	had	also	actually
dared	to	interfere	with	a	number	of	his	top	witches	and	their	work	at	that
institution.

Satan	ordered	me	to	organize	a	nationwide	effort	among	all	the	top	witches	for
that	doctor’s	destruction.	He	didn’t	care	how	we	did	it,	but	that	doctor	must	be
killed,	and	quickly.	I	did	not	know	until	almost	two	years	later	that	Rebecca	was
the	doctor	who	was	on	the	receiving	end	of	that	massive	effort	to	destroy	her	by
witchcraft.	I	shudder	to	think	what	might	have	happened	if	we	had	succeeded.
Praise	God	that	we	did	not!
Dutifully,	I	picked	up	the	phone	and	called	Helen,	who	was	by	that	time	the	head
witch	at	that	particular	hospital.	I	told	her	of	Satan’s	order	and	delegated	her	to
organize	the	rest.	I	thought	little	about	the	matter	again	for	several	months
except	to	do	the	necessary	incantations	periodically.	Then,	suddenly,	after	about
six	months,	I	began	to	realize	that	every	time	I	did	an	incantation	in	the	direction
of	that	doctor	the	demons	came	back	to	me	unable	to	get	through.	They	were	not
pleased!	This	was	a	complication	that	I	didn’t	need	just	then!	I	was	puzzled	as	I
had	never	experienced	such	a	thing	before.	I	did	not	talk	to	anyone	else	about	the
problem	because	to	admit	that	my	power	was	failing	would	have	been	fatal	for
me.
Then	about	three	weeks	before	I	turned	to	Jesus,	I	received	a	phone	call	from
Helen.	That	doctor	who	had	left	the	hospital	dying	four	months	earlier	had	just
that	day	returned	to	work.	Not	only	had	she	returned,	but	she	was	completely
healed!	I	was	shocked.	How	could	that	be?	I	realized	then	that	a	power	much
greater	than	anything	I	had	ever	seen	had	blocked	us	and	again	I	remembered	the
link	angels	in	California.	This	doctor	must	possess	the	same	power	that	that
family	had.	I	realized	that	that	power	was	Jesus	Christ.
Later	that	day	Satan	showed	up	again,	most	unhappy,	to	ask	me	why	we	had
failed.	“Don’t	you	know?!”	I	asked.	“Yes,”	he	replied,	“but	I	want	to	know	if
you	know.”
“Well	I	assume	somebody	must	have	blocked	us	by	prayer.”
“That	is	right,”	was	his	curt	answer,	then	he	vanished.
During	that	period	of	time	I	had	gone	to	the	little	church	regularly.	It	wasn’t	long
before	I	realized	that	I	was	powerless	to	destroy	it.	Those	people	were	on	to
every	trick	I	tried,	but	they	just	kept	on	loving	me	and	praying	for	me.	I	fell	in
love	with	them.	Those	people	were	genuine.	They	loved	the	Lord	so	much	that
they	didn’t	care	who	I	was,	where	I	came	from,	how	I	dressed	or	talked.	All	they
cared	about	was	my	soul.	They	cared	enough	to	keep	on	praying	and	praying.
They	prayed	me	right	up	to	the	altar	one	Sunday	night	where	I	finally	said,
“Jesus,	I	want	and	need	you,	please	forgive	me	and	come	into	my	heart	and	life.”

“Jesus,	I	want	and	need	you,	please	forgive	me	and	come	into	my	heart	and	life.”
What	a	struggle	that	was.	Mann-Chan	and	the	other	demons	tried	to	hold	my
mouth	shut.	They	kept	screaming	in	my	mind	that	I	had	been	lied	to,	God	didn’t
exist	and	Jesus	was	really	dead.	But	I	knew	that	they	were	liars	and	would	not
listen	to	them.
At	that	time	Mann-Chan	and	the	other	demons	had	a	lot	to	say	and	do.	The	first
thing	that	they	did	was	fly	right	off	and	tell	Satan	what	I	had	done.	Then	the	fur
started	to	fly!
That	night	after	I	had	returned	home	Satan	came	to	talk	to	me,	but	things	were
strangely	different.	Usually	Satan	would	come	up	to	me	and	put	his	hands	on	my
shoulders,	or	hold	me	in	his	arms.	This	time	he	stood	back	away	from	me.	I
could	see	that	he	had	many	very	powerful	demons	with	him,	but	they,	too,	stood
back	away	from	me.	Satan	was	steaming	mad!	He	shouted	at	me,
“What	in	the	Hell	do	you	think	you	are	doing?!!”
“I’m	leaving	you,”	I	replied.
“You	can’t	do	that!”
“The	Hell	I	can’t,	I	just	did!”
“You’re	my	bride,	I	won	you,	if	you	don’t	do	as	I	say	I’ll	kill	you.	You	can’t	get
out	of	that	contract!”
“I’d	a	lot	rather	die	for	God	than	I	would	stay	your	bride.	That	contract	is	no
longer	valid	because	it	is	covered	by	Jesus’	blood.	You	have	nothing	to	offer	me
but	lies	and	destruction.”
“You’ve	made	the	wrong	decision,	I’ll	prove	that	to	you	shortly.”
“You	!*@#?*	get	out	of	my	house!”
“See,	you’re	not	really	a	Christian!”
“What	do	you	mean?”
“Christians	don’t	swear.”
I	had	not	thought	about	that,	but	then	I	had	only	been	a	Christian	for	a	couple	of
hours	and	was	used	to	using	any	language	I	pleased	when	away	from	the	church.
“So	what,	I	know	I	am,	because	I	know	that	I	asked	Jesus	to	forgive	my	sins	and
to	come	into	my	heart,	and	I	know	that	he	has!”
“You	just	think	that,	it	didn’t	really	happen.”

“You	just	think	that,	it	didn’t	really	happen.”
I	was	by	then	so	angry	that	I	tried	to	take	a	step	toward	Satan	to	punch	him	in	his
nose,	but	for	some	reason	I	could-n’	t	get	my	feet	to	move.	By	that	time	Satan
was	so	angry	he	was	screaming	threats	at	me.	I	suddenly	had	a	warm	feeling	of
peace	sweep	over	me	and	I	unmistakably	heard	the	Lord	speak	to	my	heart	and
spirit	for	the	first	time.	He	said,
“Do	not	be	afraid,	my	child,	I	AM	here,	he	cannot	harm	you.”	Again	I	told	Satan
to	leave,	but	this	time	I	used	the	name	of	Jesus	and	in	an	instant	he	disappeared.
I	suppose	Satan	came	to	me	nearly	twenty	times	over	the	next	two	weeks.
Sometimes	in	a	very	charming	mood,	attempting	to	be	a	lover,	but	usually	in	a
rage.	He	tried	to	persuade	me	to	change	my	mind.	He	told	me	that	Jesus	was
dead.	He	threatened	many	things,	but	not	once	did	he	come	near	to	me.	He
always	stood	at	a	distance	and	so	did	the	demons.
Many	times	many	demons	came	obviously	planning	to	torture	me	as	the	four	had
done	in	the	past,	but	always	they	stopped	short	of	me	and	looked	confused	and
horrified	and	then	turned	and	left	without	saying	a	thing.	Gradually	I	realized
that	I	must	have	some	kind	of	special	protection	from	the	Lord.	Even	MannChan,	though	he	badgered	me	all	the	time,	did	not	seem	able	to	tear	me	as	he	had
done	in	the	past	and	now	I	had	more	control	over	him	than	he	had	over	me.
Despite	the	special	protection	I	had	Mann-Chan	did	succeed	in	making	me	very,
very	ill	and	within	two	weeks	I	ended	up	in	a	hospital	in	another	city	away	from
my	home	town.	I	did	not	at	the	time	realize	that	the	Lord	had	permitted	this.	The
long	road	to	my	complete	freedom	from	the	demons	and	arrival	at	a	full	and
complete	commitment	to	Jesus	as	Lord	and	Master	as	well	as	Savior	was	to	start
in	that	place.	So	I	ended	up	a	patient	in	a	strange	hospital,	in	a	strange	city.	I	lost
almost	everything	I	had	gained	through	Satanism	within	two	weeks	of	accepting
Jesus.	But	Praise	the	Lord,	He	was	in	control	of	all	of	that,	and	I	began	my	new
life	with	Jesus,	and	at	last	met	the	very	person	I	had	tried	so	hard	to	kill	—
Rebecca.

CHAPTER	10
The	Meeting

ELAINE	TALKS:
Within	two	weeks	of	the	day	I	made	Jesus	my	Lord	and	Master	instead	of	Satan
I	became	extremely	ill.	I	had	fled	to	another	city	which	happened	to	be	the	city
in	which	Memorial	Hospital	was	located.	I	collapsed	at	work	and	was	taken	to
the	emergency	room	by	ambulance.	I	did	not	know	a	physician	in	that	city	so
became	what	is	known	as	a	“clinic	patient”	which	meant	that	I	was	assigned	to
the	intern	and	resident	physician	on	call	for	that	night.	I	was	desperately	ill,	in
severe	pain	and	so	very	lonely	and	frightened.	It	was	in	this	state	as	I	lay	there
on	the	uncomfortable	cart	in	the	Emergency	Room	that	Rebecca	walked	into	my
life.
I	was	shocked.	In	the	first	place,	I	had	never	had	a	woman	doctor.	Secondly,	she
was	both	young	and	very	pretty.	But	more	than	that,	she	radiated	something	that
I	couldn’t	put	my	finger	on	but	felt	strongly.	The	demons	in	me	felt	it	too	and
they	didn’t	like	it	at	all.	I	could	feel	them	begin	to	twist	and	squirm	and	grumble,
telling	me	not	to	have	anything	to	do	with	this	person.
Miserable	as	I	was,	while	she	stood	talking	to	me,	my	eyes	seemed	to	be	riveted
to	the	collar	of	her	white	coat	where	she	wore	a	golden	pin	which	said,	“Jesus	Is
Life.”	Finally,	my	curiosity	overcame	my	shyness,	and,	reaching	up	to	touch	it,	I
asked,
“Are	you	a	Christian?”
“Yes,”	she	answered	smiling,	“are	you?”
I	nodded.	“I	became	a	Christian	two	weeks	ago.”
“Good	for	you!”	she	said	warmly,	“That’s	the	most	important	decision	anyone
can	ever	make.”
Then,	for	the	second	time,	that	warm	quiet	voice	within	me	spoke	saying,
“Listen	well	to	this	young	woman,	she	is	my	servant	and	will	teach	you	much
that	you	need	to	know.”	I	knew	by	then	that	that	was	the	voice	of	the	Lord,	but	I
was	still	too	scared	and	uncertain	to	trust	it	fully.	It	was	many	months	before	I
was	to	reach	the	point	of	trusting	either	the	Lord	or	Rebecca.
Rebecca	admitted	me	to	the	hospital	that	night.	The	next	morning,	much	to	my
disappointment,	I	found	that	she	was	not	going	to	be	my	primary	physician.	I
was	assigned	to	a	young	man	under	her	whom	I	disliked	intensely.	He

was	assigned	to	a	young	man	under	her	whom	I	disliked	intensely.	He
reciprocated	the	dislike,	I	might	add.	He	did	not	believe	that	I	was	having	pain	or
even	that	I	was	ill.	I	spent	many	days	and	nights	in	pain	and	tears	because	of	the
uncaring	attitude	of	that	young	man.
The	second	day	after	I	was	admitted,	Rebecca	came	back	to	talk	with	me.	She
brought	along	a	Bible	which	she	gave	to	me.	I	was	shocked	again.	Doctors	just
don’t	go	around	giving	their	patients	Bibles!	At	least	not	in	my	experience.	No
only	did	she	give	me	a	Bible,	she	also	gave	me	reading	assignments	and	prayed
with	me!
The	first	assignment	she	gave	me	was	to	read	the	book	of	James.	As	I	read	that
book	I	became	more	and	more	angry	as	it	pricked	my	conscience	again	and
again.	The	demons	didn’t	like	it	either.	We	were	all	in	a	thoroughly	foul	mood
by	the	time	she	came	around	the	next	day.	So	angry	in	fact,	that	I	threw	the	Bible
at	her.	She	just	dodged,	picked	it	up,	laughed,	and	said:
“What’s	the	matter?	Did	God’s	word	strike	some	sore	spots?	Now	here’s	your
next	assignment	.	.	.	”
Both	the	demons	and	I	were	absolutely	furious	that	our	anger	didn’t	seem	to
affect	her	at	all!	That	was	the	first	of	many	sessions	with	Rebecca	looking	into
the	scriptures.
Slowly	I	began	to	grow	spiritually.	The	demons	were	most	upset	about	that.
After	that	the	demons	would	almost	always	block	me	and	talk	to	Rebecca
instead	of	me.	They	were	anything	but	polite	as	they	tried	to	drive	her	away	from
me.	Each	day	I	thought	that	I	surely	would	not	see	her	again	but	she	always	kept
coming	back	for	more.

REBECCA	TALKS:
When	I	first	met	Elaine,	I	had	no	idea	of	who	she	was,	or	of	her	involvement	in
Satanism.	I	bought	the	Bible	for	her	at	the	Lord’s	command.	I	did	not	realize	at
the	time	that	I	was	speaking	mostly	with	the	demons	within	Elaine	instead	of
Elaine	herself.	She	was	obnoxious!	Or,	rather,	the	demons	were.	She	made	me
angry,	that	is	why	I	assigned	James	to	her	first	because	James	has	much	to	say
about	taming	the	tongue.
Elaine’s	first	stay	in	the	hospital	lasted	six	weeks.	We	put	her	through	every	test
possible	and	still	could	not	find	out	what	was	wrong.	I	had	not	learned	about
demonic	illnesses	yet	and	all	my	prayers	seeking	for	guidance	in	her	case
seemed	to	be	deliberately	unanswered.	The	other	physicians	all	concluded	that
nothing	was	really	wrong	but	I	had	no	peace	with	that	conclusion.	Nevertheless
she	was	finally	discharged.
Two	days	later,	on	my	weekend	on	call,	Elaine	came	to	the	Emergency	Room.
She	was	again	my	responsibility	until	my	intern	came	back	on	the	Monday.	She
had	the	same	complaints	of	pain	and	illness.	It	was	a	difficult	situation.	I	really
thought	that	she	was	ill	but	had	no	idea	what	was	wrong.	Her	question	to	me	was
a	challenging	one:
“Dr.	Brown,	why	am	I	still	sick?	I	even	went	and	asked	the	elders	to	anoint	me
with	oil	and	pray	and	ask	God	for	healing.	Why	doesn’t	He	answer?	Have	I	done
something	wrong?”
This	was	a	real	challenge.	Not	only	did	I	not	know	what	was	going	on	in	her
body,	but	the	Lord	had	chosen	to	remain	strangely	silent	about	her	despite	my
many	prayers	seeking	His	guidance.	I	told	Elaine	that	I	did	not	know	why	the
Lord	had	chosen	not	to	heal	her	but	that	I	was	sure	that	the	Lord	had	a	purpose
for	it	all.	I	wrote	the	admitting	orders,	thinking	that	I	would	simply	turn	her	case
over	to	my	intern	and	one	of	the	specialists	and	would	not	have	to	worry	about
her	anymore.	However,	the	Lord	and	Elaine	had	different	plans!

ELAINE	TALKS:
Until	this	second	admission	under	Rebecca’s	care,	I	had	been	relatively	safe	at
the	hospital.	Satan	and	his	demons	are	not	omnipresent	like	the	Lord	and	news
often	does	not	travel	very	fast	in	his	kingdom.	No	one	at	the	hospital	had	known
about	my	desertion	of	Satan	and	conversion	to	Christ.	But	this	time	things	were
different.	Many	of	the	doctors	and	nurses	were	satanists	and	the	word	was	out.	I
was	to	be	killed	for	becoming	a	traitor	to	Satan.	I	spent	my	whole	time	fighting
for	my	life.	I	was	much	stronger	than	any	of	the	satanists	there	and	won	fairly
easily.
I	did	not	know	that	I	was	not	supposed	to	use	my	powers	and	Satan	and	the
demons	continued	to	let	me	use	them	because	they	knew	that	so	long	as	I	did	so
I	could	not	really	grow	as	I	should	spiritually.	I	did	not,	of	course,	tell	Rebecca
about	any	of	this.	I	did	not	trust	her	yet,	but	she	was	so	different	than	any	other
doctor	that	I	had	ever	run	into	that	I	was	determined	to	keep	her	as	my	own
physician.
The	next	day	when	the	specialist	came	to	see	me	I	recognized	him	immediately.
He	was	one	of	the	higher	satanists	locally.	I	had	never	liked	him.	I	deliberately
picked	a	fight	with	him	and	my	demons	thoroughly	beat	him	up.	In	fact,	after
that	first	battle	he	was	so	wounded	physically	that	he	could	not	come	into	the
hospital	to	work	for	three	days.	It	only	took	one	week	to	make	him	hate	and	fear
me	so	much	that	he	refused	to	see	me	anymore,	which	was	precisely	what	I
wanted.	The	intern	was	a	different	matter.	He	was	not	a	satanist,	but	not	a
Christian	either.	He	already	disliked	me,	but	was	bound	by	the	rules	of	his
training	program	to	care	for	me.
I	made	his	life	miserable	even	as	he	made	mine	miserable.	I	astral-projected	into
his	apartment	and	wrote	all	over	his	walls	very	impolite	messages	with	a	black
marking	pen,	then	signed	my	name	to	it.	I	threw	dishes	at	him	when	he	was
home	and	several	times	unplugged	his	refrigerator	so	that	all	the	food	in	it
spoiled.	Everytime	he	tried	to	bring	anyone	to	see	the	messages	on	the	walls	one
of	my	demons	would	tell	me	ahead	of	time	and	I	would	have	the	demon
completely	clean	the	wall	before	anyone	else	could	see	the	writing.	He	quickly
learned	that	he	couldn’t	say	anything	to	anyone	else	about	what	was	going	on
because	they	all	thought	he	was	going	crazy.	He	grew	to	hate	and	fear	me	so
much	that	within	two	weeks	he,	too,	refused	to	remain	on	my	case.	That	left

Rebecca.	There	was	a	love	which	radiated	from	her	that	I	could	not	understand
but	was	drawn	to.	I	was	fast	growing	to	love	her	and	deep	down	knew	that	she
was	the	only	one	who	had	the	answers	to	set	me	free.

REBECCA	TALKS:
My	relief	concerning	Elaine’s	case	was	short	lived.	Less	than	two	weeks	after
her	admission	the	intern	came	to	me	and	told	me	that	he	did	not	care	what	the
consequences	were,	he	would	not	have	anything	more	to	do	with	Elaine,	and	by
the	end	of	that	first	week,	the	specialist	came	and	told	me	that	he	did	not	care
what	I	did	with	Elaine,	he	was	washing	his	hands	of	her	case.	He	would	not	be
seeing	her	again.	I	was	stuck!	I	didn’t	know	what	to	do	with	her	either!
As	I	saw	Elaine	from	day	to	day	we	seemed	to	consistently	reach	only	a	certain
point	in	her	spiritual	growth	and	then	were	blocked	by	something.	Mostly	she
was	completely	obnoxious.	I	did	not	know	that	the	demons	in	her	were	trying	to
drive	me	away.	I	did	not	even	know	she	had	demons!	Time	after	time,	in	total
frustration	I	wanted	to	simply	discharge	her	and	tell	her	there	was	nothing	more	I
could	do	to	help	her.	Always	when	I	reached	that	point,	the	Lord	would	allow
Satan	to	tempt	me	so	that	I	would	fall	flat	on	my	face	and	fail,	and	would	have	to
humbly	ask	the	Lord’s	forgiveness.	When	I	did,	He	always	said	to	me,	“Now	see
the	patience	I	have	to	have	with	you,	can’t	you	extend	that	same	patience	to	my
child	Elaine?”	Of	course,	the	Lord	always	won!	So,	again	I	would	ask	the	Lord
to	put	His	love	in	my	heart	for	Elaine,	and	go	back	to	see	her	the	next	day.
Finally,	after	about	three	weeks	I	got	serious	and	spent	a	whole	weekend	in
prayer	and	fasting	asking	the	Lord	to	give	me	the	key	to	Elaine’s	case.	Late	that
Sunday	evening	Father	spoke	to	me	and	said,	“You	have	not	talked	to	Elaine
about	her	deep	involvement	in	the	occult.”	It	all	seemed	so	simple	then.	I	should
have	recognized	the	symptoms,	but	Satan	had	blocked	my	mind.
That	Monday	morning,	I	went	in	and	told	Elaine	that	there	was	one	area	that	we
had	not	yet	discussed.
“What	is	that?”
“Your	deep	involvement	in	the	occult.”
She	was	obviously	shocked.	She	sat	staring	at	me	in	silence	for	a	full	minute.
“How	did	you	know	about	that?!”
“I	spent	this	past	weekend	in	fasting	and	prayer	asking	Father	to	reveal	to	me	the
key	to	your	case.	He	told	me.”
I	told	her	that	as	a	Christian	she	must	confess	any	and	all	involvements	in	the

I	told	her	that	as	a	Christian	she	must	confess	any	and	all	involvements	in	the
occult	to	the	Lord	as	wrong	and	ask	His	forgiveness	and	then	ask	Him	to	take	it
all	away	and	to	close	the	doorways	with	His	precious	blood.	She	was	completely
resistant	to	this.	Finally,	in	desperation,	I	said:
“Elaine,	I	can’t	handle	you.	But	I	know	who	can	and	that	is	the	Lord.	So	I’m
going	to	pray	now	and	commit	you	into	His	hands	and	ask	Him	to	deal	with
you.”	I	did	so,	and	left.

ELAINE	TALKS:
I	have	never	been	so	shocked	in	my	life	as	I	was	when	Rebecca	coolly	walked	in
that	day	and	asked	me	about	my	involvement	in	the	occult.	I	knew	that	there
were	only	two	places	she	could	have	gotten	that	information.	One	was	from
Satan	and	the	other	was	from	God.	That	was	a	real	turning	point	in	my	life,
however.	When	Rebecca	prayed	asking	the	Lord	to	“handle”	me,	He	certainly
did!	In	fact,	Rebecca	prayed	that	prayer	daily	from	that	point	on.	How	I	hated	for
her	to	do	that,	but	the	Lord	broke	through	all	the	demonic	interference	and	over
the	following	days	and	weeks	I	slowly	began	to	understand	that	as	a	Christian	I
must	make	Jesus	the	total	Master	in	my	life	as	well	as	Savior.
I	came	to	trust	Rebecca	more	and	more	and	my	love	for	her	grew	as	well.	I	came
to	realize	her	deep	commitment	to	the	Lord	and	began	to	try	to	pattern	my	life
after	hers.	I	learned	through	her	that	the	contract	I	had	first	signed	in	my	own
blood	years	ago	was	indeed	completely	cancelled	out	by	the	blood	of	Jesus.	The
struggle	was	not	easy	for	me,	or	for	Rebecca.	But	each	day,	through	God’s
grace,	I	grew	a	bit	more	spiritually	and	my	physical	problems	began	to	clear	up.
At	last	the	day	came	when	Rebecca	told	me	that	she	had	received	guidance	from
the	Lord	that	the	time	had	come	for	me	to	learn	to	stand	on	my	own	feet	against
Satan	outside	of	the	hospital.	So,	I	was	discharged	for	the	last	time.

CHAPTER	11
Entering	Spiritual	Warfare

REBECCA	TALKS:
I	continued	to	see	Elaine	as	an	outpatient	for	a	month	after	she	was	finally
discharged	from	the	hospital.	Then	Satan	“lowered	the	boom.”	Elaine	called	me
at	home	one	night	and	I	immediately	recognized	that	she	was	deeply	upset.	She
had	received	a	letter	from	The	Brotherhood	that	day	and	so	had	I.
The	letter	to	me	detailed	my	activities	of	the	past	two	weeks	perfectly,	right
down	to	what	I	had	bought	at	the	grocery	store.	They	knew	my	address	and
phone	number.	They	told	me	that	if	I	ever	spoke	to	or	saw	Elaine	again	that	they
would	come	and	get	me	and	sacrifice	me.	Elaine’s	letter	told	her	that	if	she	ever
saw	or	spoke	to	me,	and	that	if	she	did	not	return	and	repent	and	serve	Satan
again,	that	they	would	get	her	and	sacrifice	her	at	the	upcoming	Black	Sabbath.
One	line	in	each	of	our	letters	was	very	similar	to	the	letter	from	the	field
commander	of	the	king	of	Assyria	to	King	Hezekiah.	They	said,	“You	two	are
fools	if	you	think	your	God	can	protect	you	from	our	Prince	of	Darkness!”	(See
Isaiah	chapters	36	&	37.)
“What	should	we	do?”	Elaine	asked.	She	wanted	to	sever	all	contact	with	me	in
hopes	of	preventing	the	cult	from	harming	me,	but	I	was	sure	that	that	was	not
the	Lord’s	will.	Shaken,	I	told	her	that	I	must	take	the	situation	to	the	Lord	in
prayer	and	ask	Him	what	He	wanted	us	to	do.	I	knew	that	we	could	not	run
away.	You	cannot	hide	anywhere	from	Satan.	I	knew	too,	as	did	Elaine,	just	how
capable	these	people	were	of	carrying	out	their	threats.	I	remembered	the	young
pastor	who	had	fallen	into	their	hands	and	was	almost	tortured	to	death.	I	also
knew	what	was	awaiting	me	if	the	cult	got	their	hands	on	me.	The	Lord	had,	not
long	before,	given	me	a	vision	of	how	a	virgin	is	sacrificed	in	that	group	—
death	is	a	pleasant	release	for	the	victim!
I	took	the	problem	to	the	Lord	in	prayer.	He	told	me	that	He	wanted	me	to	have
Elaine	move	in	with	me	immediately	as	she	did	not	yet	have	faith	enough	to
stand	on	her	own.	She	had	been	divorced	for	a	number	of	years	and	had	no	close
friends.	Her	daughter	was	temporarily	staying	with	her	step-sister	because	of	her
prolonged	illness	and	hospitalization,	so	she	was	alone.	Father	told	me	that	she
would	commit	suicide	rather	than	fall	into	the	hands	of	the	cult.	She	knew	only
too	well	what	fate	awaited	her.	Moving	Elaine	in	with	me	would	bring	the	attack
directly	to	my	own	home.
I	was	literally	ill	with	fear	for	two	days	as	I	struggled	with	the	decision.
Basically,	I	am	not	martyr	material!	I	could	not	face	the	physical	torture	that

Basically,	I	am	not	martyr	material!	I	could	not	face	the	physical	torture	that
surely	awaited	me	if	The	Brotherhood	got	their	hands	on	me	and,	by	that	time,	I
had	grown	to	love	Elaine	and	could	not	face	seeing	her	so	tortured	either.	I	also
realized	that	I	had	been	daily	asking	the	Lord	to	allow	me	to	stand	in	the	gap	for
that	area	for	almost	two	years.	I	knew	that	since	I	was	in	the	gap	it	might	be
necessary	for	the	Lord	to	allow	Satan	to	put	his	hand	on	me	as	he	has	on	so
many	down	through	the	ages	from	Stephen,	the	first	Christian	martyr,	on.
I	knew	that	to	take	the	problem	to	the	police	would	be	useless	as	so	many	of
them	were	involved	in	The	Brotherhood	in	that	area.	Elaine	and	I	were	helpless
in	the	face	of	so	large	and	well	trained	an	army	as	Satan	had.	Yet	at	the	same
time	I	also	knew	that	to	refuse	to	do	Father’s	will	would	be	the	same	as	denying
Jesus.	Finally,	the	second	night,	I	got	honest	with	the	Lord.	I	threw	myself	prone
on	my	face	before	Father	and	sobbed	my	eyes	out,	saying:
“Father,	Father,	I	am	so	terribly	afraid.	I	just	cannot	face	such	physical	torture	or
face	the	possibility	of	seeing	Elaine	so	tortured.	But	also,	I	simply	cannot	deny
Jesus	or	You.	I	just	can’t!	I	will	do	your	will,	but	please	help	me,	I	am	so
afraid!”
At	that	point	the	Lord	began	to	minister	to	me.	I	really	wasn’t	any	less	afraid,	but
somehow	I	had	the	strength	to	go	on	and	do	what	I	knew	I	had	to	do.	I	called
Elaine	the	next	morning	and	told	her	that	I	was	coming	to	get	her	that	afternoon
after	work,	that	she	must	come	and	move	in	with	me.	She	was	shocked	and	told
me	that	I	was	absolutely	crazy	and	that	she	did	not	want	to	do	so.	But	I	told	her
that	that	was	Father’s	command	and	that	she	did	not	have	any	choice	if	she
really	meant	to	follow	and	serve	Jesus.	So	that	day	Elaine	moved	in	with	me	and
we	have	lived	and	served	the	Lord	together	ever	since.
We	had	two	weeks	to	wait	before	the	night	of	The	Brotherhood’s	Black	Sabbath.
They	were	furious	about	Elaine’s	move	and	let	us	know	in	no	uncertain	terms	in
all	kinds	of	harassment.	Phone	calls	at	all	hours,	banging	on	the	side	of	the	house
and	at	the	doors	in	the	middle	of	the	night,	rocks	thrown	through	our	windows	at
night.	They	even	shot	holes	in	the	walls	of	the	house.
In	the	meantime,	I	felt	that	the	battle	was	really	a	spiritual	one.	Only	God	could
fight	it.	I	read	and	shared	with	Elaine	the	story	of	King	Jehoshaphat	in	II
Chronicles	20.	A	vast	army	had	marched	against	King	Jehoshaphat.	He	could	not
hope	to	stand	against	that	army.	So	he	and	all	his	people	took	the	problem	to	the
Lord	in	prayer,	and	the	Lord	answered	them	that	the	battle	was	His	and	that	He,
the	Lord,	would	protect	them.	I	told	Elaine	that	our	only	hope	was	to	stand	in
faith	that	the	Lord	would	fight	this	battle	for	us.	We	had	to	simply	trust	that	if	He

faith	that	the	Lord	would	fight	this	battle	for	us.	We	had	to	simply	trust	that	if	He
did	not	choose	to	do	so	that	He	would	give	us	the	strength	to	endure	whatever
His	will	was	for	us.	My	prayer	was	that	if	He	did	allow	the	group	to	torture	us
that	He	would	give	us	the	strength	not	to	deny	Jesus	no	matter	what	they	did	to
us.	Whatever	the	outcome	was	to	be,	I	knew	that	I	was	to	stand	by	Elaine	and
support	her	faith	to	the	end.
I	did	not	share	any	of	this	with	my	parents	as	I	did	not	want	to	risk	bringing	the
wrath	of	The	Brotherhood	upon	them.	In	fact,	we	had	no	one	to	turn	to	for	help
except	the	Lord.	I	did	have	to	tell	my	roommate	what	was	going	on,	and	she	was
so	scared	that	she	moved	out	for	those	two	weeks.
As	the	two	weeks	passed	by	and	the	harassment	grew,	over	and	over	Elaine	and	I
sat	down	and	read	that	passage	in	Chronicles.	The	day	before	The	Brotherhood’s
Black	Sabbath,	I	was	sitting	in	the	library	of	the	hospital	when	one	of	the
Christian	medical	students	came	by	and	dropped	a	card	in	my	lap.	It	had	some
scripture	verses	on	it.	She	told	me	that	she	didn’t	know	why	she	was	giving	them
to	me,	but	that	Father	had	been	steadily	putting	it	on	her	heart	to	write	them
down	and	give	them	to	me	for	the	past	three	days.	I	still	have	that	card.	Here	is
exactly	what	it	said:
“Fear	not	and	be	not	dismayed	...	for	the	battle	is	not	yours	but	God’s.
You	will	not	need	to	fight	in	this	battle;	take	your	position,	stand	still,
and	see	the	victory	of	the	Lord	on	your	behalf.”	11	Chronicles	20:15	&
17
Those	were	the	very	verses	that	Elaine	and	I	had	been	standing	on!	I	will	never
be	able	to	express	what	I	felt	in	that	moment.	For	the	first	time,	I	knew,	without
doubt,	that	Father	meant	to	fight	the	battle	for	us	and	that	we	would	be	safe.	And
so	we	were.
The	night	that	The	Brotherhood	had	specified,	Elaine	and	I	sat	up	until	midnight
listening	to	records	and	singing	praises	to	the	Lord.	As	the	clock	struck	12
midnight,	the	record	playing	was	by	Bill	and	Gloria	Gaither.	The	song	they	were
singing	was	It	Is	Finished.	And	we	stood	and	praised	God	that	it	was	finished.
He	had	kept	His	word.	He	had	fought	the	battle	for	us.	We	were	unharmed.	We
went	to	bed	then	and	slept	in	peace	the	rest	of	the	night.
The	next	day	after	the	Black	Sabbath	of	The	Brotherhood,	the	battle	really	began
in	earnest.	The	demons	in	Elaine	began	to	openly	try	to	kill	her.	Up	to	that	point,
she	had	persistently	denied	that	demons	were	in	her,	but	that	evening	she	was
suddenly	seized	and	thrown	to	the	floor	with	excruciating	chest	pain	as	if	she
were	having	a	heart	attack.	I	didn’t	know	what	to	do,	so	I	cried	out	to	the	Lord	to

were	having	a	heart	attack.	I	didn’t	know	what	to	do,	so	I	cried	out	to	the	Lord	to
intervene.	He	did	and	the	pain	ended.
“Elaine,	that	must	have	been	a	demon!	Why	do	you	continue	to	refuse	to	admit
it?”
“Yes,	it	was	Mann-Chan.	He	is	trying	to	give	me	a	heart	attack.”
“Who	is	Mann-Chan?”
“Mann-Chan	is	the	demon	that	has	been	my	guiding	spirit	for	years.	He	has
orders	from	Satan	to	kill	me.”
I	knew	very	little	about	fighting	demons	at	that	point	but	I	thought	that	they
surely	must	be	resisted	in	the	same	way	the	Lord	had	taught	me	to	resist	Satan
—	that	is,	out	loud	and	in	the	name	of	Jesus.	I	told	Elaine	about	this	and	told	her
that	she	should,	out	loud,	in	the	name	of	Jesus,	command	him	to	stop	and	go
away.	Elaine	found	such	a	suggestion	very	embarrassing	and	flatly	refused	to
address	Mann-Chan	out	loud.	Time	after	time	over	the	next	two	days	MannChan	threw	Elaine	to	the	floor.	Always	she	refused	to	open	her	mouth	and
finally	I	would	command	him	to	stop	in	the	name	of	Jesus	and	he	would	stop.
I	knew	that	Elaine	must	learn	to	fight	also,	that	the	Lord	would	not	permit	me	to
fight	for	her	indefinitely.	I	had	come	up	against	the	stubbornness	that	had
enabled	Elaine	to	survive	all	these	years,	only	now,	it	was	directed	in	the	wrong
way.	Finally,	the	third	day,	in	utter	desperation,	as	Mann-Chan	was	attacking
Elaine,	I	marched	her	to	the	front	door.	Opening	it	I	told	her:
“If	you	don’t	humble	yourself	and	address	Mann-Chan	out	loud	as	the	Lord
wants	and	stand	up	and	fight	him,	he	will	kill	you.	Now	go	outside	where	no	one
can	hear	you	and	don’t	come	back	until	the	issue	is	settled!	If	you	let	him	kill
you,	I	don’t	want	him	doing	it	in	the	middle	of	my	living	room	floor!”
Out	she	went	and	immediately	I	was	engulfed	in	horror.	What	had	I	done?
Suppose	he	did	kill	her?	I	certainly	did	not	want	that	to	happen.	Had	I	been	too
harsh	on	her?	I	fell	to	my	knees	and	prayed	intensely	for	her.	As	I	was	praying,	a
couple	of	minutes	later,	Elaine	sheepishly	came	back	into	the	house.	I	was
immensely	relieved	to	see	that	she	was	all	in	one	piece.
“Well,	what	happened?”
“I	did	as	you	said	and	commanded	him	to	leave,	and	he	did.”
From	that	time	on	the	battle	grew.	Ri-Chan	began	to	afflict	her	and	many	others.
Within	a	week	I	knew	that	if	the	demons	were	not	cast	out	that	they	would	kill
her.	I	had	never	really	dealt	with	casting	out	a	demon	and	was	not	sure	what	to

her.	I	had	never	really	dealt	with	casting	out	a	demon	and	was	not	sure	what	to
do.	So,	I	called	Pastor	Pat	on	a	Wednesday	morning	and	told	him	about	the
situation.	(I	did	not	contact	the	pastor	of	the	church	I	attended	locally	by	the
hospital	because	I	did	not	feel	he	would	be	able	to	help	me.	Later	his	actions
proved	that	the	discernment	given	to	me	by	the	Lord	was	accurate.)	I	told	him
that	I	felt	that	if	Elaine	wasn’t	delivered	that	day	that	she	would	be	killed.	He
told	me	to	bring	her	down	to	the	prayer	meeting	that	night	and	that	afterwards
we	would	deal	with	the	demons	as	the	Lord	led.
It	was	a	major	battle	to	get	Elaine	down	to	the	church	as	the	demons	in	her	did
everything	to	keep	me	from	getting	her	there.	I	had	to	practically	carry	her	out	to
the	car	and	then	seat-belted	her	in.	The	suffering	Elaine	was	enduring	by	me	the
prayer	meeting	was	over	no	one	but	the	Lord	will	ever	know.	The	demons	were
ripping	and	tearing	at	her	body	from	the	inside,	trying	to	kill	her	before	they
could	be	cast	out.	I	greatly	admire	Elaine’s	courage	and	determination	to	be
delivered.	She	did	not	once	complain	of	the	agony	she	was	enduring.
After	the	prayer	meeting	Pastor	Pat	asked	Elaine	and	me	to	join	with	him	and
two	elders	of	the	church	in	his	study.	I	don’t	think	that	either	of	the	elders	had
ever	participated	in	deliverance	session	before	either.	Pastor	Pat	had.	He	opened
with	prayer.	He	asked	the	Lord	to	seal	that	room	with	His	angels	so	that	nothing
could	get	in	and	we	could	not	get	out	until	the	work	we	had	come	to	do	had	been
completed.	Elaine	and	I	looked	at	each	other.	I	knew	that	she	was	thinking	the
same	thing	I	was:	“WOW!!	NOW	WHAT?”
After	praying,	the	Pastor	addressed	Elaine	asking	her	to	confirm	that	she	had
made	Jesus	the	Savior,	Lord,	and	Master	of	her	life,	that	she	rejected	Satan	and
anything	from	him	and	that	she	desired	the	demons	to	leave.	She	did	go.	From
that	point	the	battle	was	on.	The	demons	began	to	surface	and	speak	through
Elaine.	I	had	never	seen	anything	like	it.	Her	eyes,	voice,	and	whole	face
changed.	I	will	never	forget	the	first	demon.	Suddenly	a	guttural	male	voice	said,
“I	am	Yaagogg,	the	demon	of	death,	and	you	are	all	fools.	You	cannot	win;	we
will	kill	this	foul	traitor.	She	belongs	to	Satan	and	he	will	not	permit	her	to	live.”
Pastor	Pat	didn’t	bat	an	eyelash.
“You	lie,	you	foul	spirit!	Elaine	is	now	holy	ground,	she	belongs	to	the	Lord	and
you	know	it!	I	command	you	in	the	name	of	Jesus	to	come	out	of	her!”
The	battle	raged	for	eight	hours.	Many	many	demons	were	brought	to	the
surface,	forced	to	identify	themselves	and	were	cast	out.	It	was	a	beautiful
experience.	The	Holy	Spirit	was	absolutely	in	control	and	there	was	a	smooth

experience.	The	Holy	Spirit	was	absolutely	in	control	and	there	was	a	smooth
coordination	of	all	of	us	as	He	used	first	one	of	us	then	another.	The	presence	of
the	Lord	in	that	room	was	felt	by	all	of	us.	We	commanded	the	demons	to	come
out	of	Elaine	by	the	authority	of	the	name	of	Jesus,	read	scripture	aloud,	sang
songs	of	praise	to	the	Lord	and	prayed	and	praised	Jesus	for	His	complete
victory	over	Satan.	The	demons	were	particularly	tormented	by	our	praise	and
they	seemed	to	lose	strength	rapidly	then.	Most	of	them	came	out	by	violent
coughing.
What	a	time	of	joy	and	rejoicing	we	had	when	the	deliverance	session	finally
ended.	We	all	stood	crying,	clapping	our	hands	and	praising	the	Lord	in
complete	and	beautiful	unity.	Exhausted	but	overjoyed,	Elaine	and	I	praised	the
Lord	all	the	way	home.
The	weeks	following	Elaine’s	first	deliverance	were	intensive	weeks	of
decisions	that	would	affect	the	rest	of	both	of	our	lives.	The	Lord	spoke	to	me	at
the	beginning	of	that	week.	He	asked	me	if	I	would	be	willing	to	commit	my	life
to	Him	in	a	new	way,	to	be	used	by	Him	in	any	way	He	chose	to	directly	fight
Satan,	and	stand	“in	the	gap”	so	that	many	souls	could	be	saved,	especially
among	those	of	The	Brotherhood.	The	Lord	told	me	that	if	I	chose	such	a	course
that	I	could	expect	suffering	and	persecution.	Also	that	I	would	have	to	change
my	career	plans.	He	showed	me	that	I	could	expect	much	loneliness	and
rejection	and	eventually	have	to	lay	down	my	medical	career	completely,	but
that	He	would	always	be	with	me.	He	also	told	me	that	I	would	lose	my	entire
family,	which	I	have.
It	was	a	big	decision.	I	have	always	loved	the	field	of	oncology	and	had,	just	the
month	before,	been	accepted	into	a	Fellowship	Program	to	train	in	oncology	at
one	of	the	oldest	and	most	prestigious	institutions	in	the	U.S.	Oncology	is	the
field	in	medicine	which	specializes	in	the	treatment	of	cancer.	Being	accepted	to
that	particular	program	was	considered	a	great	honor.	I	wanted	very	much	to
specialize	in	that	field.	The	Lord	told	me	that	He	does	not	give	His	children
second	rate	options	and	that	if	I	did	not	choose	to	commit	my	life	to	doing	battle
with	Satan,	that	He	would	greatly	bless	me	anyway.
The	decision	was	a	hard	one.	The	Lord	wanted	me	to	stay	in	internal	medicine
and	open	a	private	solo	practice	so	that	I	would	have	a	broader	range	of	patients.
This	was	necessary	so	that	He	could	bring	to	me	the	people	I	was	to	minister	to,
especially	cult	members.	As	I	thought	about	it,	I	realized	that	I	loved	the	Lord
too	much	to	do	anything	other	than	His	first	choice.	As	I	mentioned	this	to	a	few
of	my	“Christian”	colleagues	at	the	hospital	and	the	fact	that	I	would	have	to
refuse	the	position	in	the	oncology	fellowship,	they	all	told	me	that	I	was	crazy

refuse	the	position	in	the	oncology	fellowship,	they	all	told	me	that	I	was	crazy
to	even	think	of	refusing	such	a	position.
Also,	many	of	my	friends	were	beginning	to	pressure	me	to	have	Elaine	move
out.	Those	that	did	not	know	that	I	had	moved	Elaine	in	with	me	also	began	to
turn	against	me	for	no	explainable	reason.	Satan	worked	in	such	a	manner	that
by	the	end	of	that	week	I	did	not	have	one	friend	left.	My	family	and	my
roommate	were	also	pressuring	me	to	have	Elaine	move	out.	They	did	not	think	I
was	hearing	the	Lord	correctly.
Even	the	minister	of	the	church	I	attended	locally	by	the	hospital,	called	me	and
counseled	me	to	have	Elaine	move	out.	He,	too,	told	me	that	I	“...	got	too
involved	with	people,	and	especially	with	Elaine.”	Then	he	went	on	to	tell	me
that	I	was	not	welcome	to	return	to	his	church	until	I	had	gotten	rid	of	Elaine!
I	was	shaken	and	began	to	wonder	if	I	had	really	heard	the	Lord	correctly.	But
during	that	time,	the	Holy	Spirit	forcibly	brought	to	my	mind	the	scripture	in	I
Peter	1:22,	“...	see	that	ye	love	one	another	with	a	pure	heart	fervently.”	That
certainly	didn’t	sound	like	a	surface-only	involvement	to	me.	Also	the	Holy
Spirit	quickened	Galatians	6:2	to	my	heart,	“Bear	ye	one	another’s	burdens,	and
so	fulfill	the	law	of	Christ.”	Once	again	I	had	peace	in	my	heart	and	spirit	that	I
was	hearing	the	Lord	correctly.
Nevertheless,	by	the	end	of	that	week,	I	was	both	discouraged	and	depressed.	I
saw	Pastor	Pat	that	next	Sunday	again,	and	shared	with	him	what	had	been
happening,	and	also	my	depression.	I	will	never	forget	the	experience.	Pastor	Pat
looked	me	square	in	the	eye	and	said:
“Rebecca,	entering	into	spiritual	warfare	in	a	deep	commitment	such	as	you	are
describing	will	mean	much	rejection	and	suffering.	If	you	can’t	take	it,	then
you’d	better	get	out	now!”
I	felt	about	two	inches	tall!	But	it	was	what	I	needed	to	hear.	The	next	day	I
made	my	decision.	I	told	the	Lord	that	I	gave	my	life	to	Him	to	be	used	in	this
new	dimension,	totally	committed	to	Him	to	be	used	in	any	way	He	chose	to
directly	battle	Satan	in	order	that	souls	could	be	saved,	and	Jesus	glorified.
Then	I	sat	down	and	wrote	the	director	of	the	fellowship	program	in	oncology
and	told	him	that	after	much	prayer	I	knew	that	it	was	not	the	Lord’s	will	for	me
to	take	that	direction	in	my	career	and	that	I	would	not	be	coming	after	all.	What
a	furor	that	decision	raised	at	the	hospital!	The	directors	of	my	program	were
angry	and	could	not	understand	my	decision.	I	tried	to	explain	to	them	that	it	was
not	the	Lord’s	will	for	me	to	become	an	oncologist.	They	thought	I	was	crazy,
after	all,	“God	doesn’t	speak	to	people	like	that.”

after	all,	“God	doesn’t	speak	to	people	like	that.”
Most	Christians	are	quite	unaware	not	only	of	the	spirit	world,	but	of	the	fact
that	every	action	we	take	in	our	physical	world	also	affects	the	spirit	world.
Charles	G.	Finney	describes	this	cause	and	effect	relationship	between	the
physical	and	spiritual	worlds	beautifully:
“Every	Christian	makes	an	impression	by	his	conduct,	and	witnesses
either	for	one	side	or	the	other.	His	looks.	dress.	whole	demeanor,	make	a
constant	impression	on	one	side	or	the	other.	He	cannot	help	testifying
for	or	against	religion.	He	is	either	gathering	with	Christ,	or	scattering
abroad.	At	every	step	you	tread	on	chords	that	will	vibrate	to	all	eternity.
Every	time	you	move,	you	touch	keys	whose	sound	will	reecho	all	over
the	hills	and	dales	of	heaven,	and	through	all	the	dark	caverns	and	vaults
of	hell.	Every	movement	of	your	lives,	you	are	exerting	a	tremendous
influence	that	will	tell	on	the	immortal	interests	of	souls	all	around	you.”
The	Last	Call	...	For	Real	Revival,	by	J.T.C.,	p.	31.
An	incident	happened	which	suddenly	made	this	truth	a	reality	to	me.	I	had	not
realized	the	significance	of	the	waves	of	reaction	in	the	spirit	world	to	the	events
in	my	own	life.	First,	I	had	been	involved	in	using	the	power	of	Jesus	Christ	to
block	much	of	the	witchcraft	in	one	of	Satan’s	special	hospitals.	Then,	the	Lord
had	involved	me	in	the	battle	in	which	Satan	lost	one	of	his	top	brides	—	an
event	which	certainly	caused	Satan	to	lose	face	in	his	kingdom.	Shortly	after	that
Satan	and	his	demons	failed	in	their	attempt	to	use	Elaine	and	myself	as	human
sacrifices	because	the	Lord	had	intervened	and	protected	us.	I	guess	the	last
straw,	so	to	speak,	was	my	total	committal	of	my	life	to	the	Lord	to	be	used	in
warfare	directly	against	Satan.
Quite	unaware	of	the	“waves”	all	of	this	was	causing	in	the	spirit	world,	I	calmly
went	out	into	my	back	yard	one	day	to	have	a	quiet	lunch	on	my	picnic	table
under	the	trees.	As	I	was	sitting	there	enjoying	the	sunshine	God	permitted	the
veil	between	the	spirit	world	and	the	physical	world	to	be	briefly	torn	asunder.
Suddenly,	a	shining	figure	appeared	and	sat	down	across	the	table	from	me.	He
was	in	form	as	a	man.	As	I	sat	staring	at	him	in	silent	amazement	the	Holy	Spirit
forcibly	revealed	to	me	who	he	was!	This	was	the	last	being	I	had	ever	expected
to	personally	meet.	This	shining	figure	presenting	himself	to	me	in	radiance	as
an	“angel	of	light”	was	actually	the	Prince	of	Darkness,	the	Prince	of	the	Power
of	the	Air,	ruler	over	a	vast	kingdom	of	evil	—	Satan,	himself!	I	don’t	remember
details	about	his	appearance	because	I	could	not	seem	to	draw	my	eyes	away
from	his,	his	eyes	were	so	evil.	They	were	like	black	coals	and	had	a	depth	and

from	his,	his	eyes	were	so	evil.	They	were	like	black	coals	and	had	a	depth	and
blackness	and	evilness	that	seemed	to	reach	out	threatening	to	engulf	me.	For	an
instant	I	felt	as	if	I	was	falling	forward	into	the	black	pit	that	was	in	those	eyes,
but	something	held	me	back,	stabilizing	me.	I	could	tell	that	Satan	was	angry,
very	angry.
“Satan!”	I	exclaimed.	Upon	receiving	his	curt	nod	acknowledging	his	identity,	I
asked,	“What	do	you	want?”
“Woman,	do	you	dare	to	come	against	me?”
“My	life	has	been	so	committed.”
“I	know,	but,	DO	YOU	DARE	to	actually	come	against	ME?!”
I	was	very	puzzled	and	surprised	at	his	repeated	question.	It	was	obvious	that	his
anger	was	growing	by	the	moment,	but	the	Holy	Spirit	filled	me	with	a	complete
peace	such	that	afterwards	I	marveled	that	I	had	felt	no	fear.
“Satan,	I	am	not	coming	against	you	in	my	own	power,	but	in	the	power	and
authority	of	Jesus	Christ.”
“You	had	better	count	the	cost,	this	Jesus	whom	you	serve	advised	His
followers.”	(And	he	quoted	accurately	word	for	word	the	following:)
“For	which	of	you,	intending	to	build	a	tower,	sitteth	not	down	first,	and
counteth	the	cost,	whether	he	have	sufficient	to	finish	it?	Lest	haply,	after
he	hath	laid	the	foundation,	and	is	not	able	to	finish	it,	all	that	behold	it
begin	to	mock	him,	Saying,	This	man	began	to	build,	and	was	not	able	to
finish.	Or	what	king,	going	to	make	war	against	another	king,	sitteth	not
down	first,	and	consulteth	whether	he	be	able	with	ten	thousand	to	meet
him	that	cometh	against	him	with	twenty	thousand?	Or	else,	while	the
other	is	yet	a	great	way	off,	he	sendeth	an	ambassage,	and	desireth
conditions	of	peace.
So	likewise,	whosoever	he	be	of	you	that	forsaketh	not	all	that	he	hath,
he	cannot	be	my	disciple.”	Luke	14:28-33
“Woman	you	had	better	count	the	cost	because	I	tell	you,	I	will	make	your	life
an	agony	and	an	anguish	that	you	never	knew	could	even	exist!”
I	knew	this	powerful	creature	was	deadly	serious	and	that	since	I	had	committed
everything	to	the	Lord	(all	my	possessions,	career,	family,	my	very	life	itself),	I
had	no	doubt	that	Satan	would	petition	Father	for	it	all	just	as	he	had	done	many
years	ago	with	Job.	It	was	a	very	sobering	thought.	Finally	I	replied:

“I	have	counted	the	cost	to	the	best	of	my	ability	and	I	know	that	whatever	is	to
come	in	the	future	will	be	under	the	complete	control	of	my	God,	and	I	simply
trust	that	His	grace	will	be	sufficient	for	me.	So,	YES,	Satan,	I	DO	DARE	to
take	up	the	authority	and	power	that	Jesus	has	given	me,	and	I	DO	DARE	to
come	against	you	in	the	name	of	Jesus	Christ	my	Lord!”
My	eyes	locked	with	Satan’s	for	a	long	moment	of	silence.	Again	I	had	that
peculiar	sensation	that	if	something	had	not	been	holding	me,	I	would	have
fallen	forward	into	the	awful	evil	that	I	saw	there.	Then	Satan	nodded	curtly	and
said,	“So	be	it.”	With	those	words,	he	vanished.
I	sat	pondering	the	experience;	wondering	that	the	sun	had	continued	to	shine
warmly,	the	breeze	gently	rustling	the	leaves	on	the	trees,	and	the	birds	had
continued	to	sing.	I	sensed	that	somehow	I	had	just	taken	a	major	irrevocable
step.	At	the	time	of	this	writing	the	cost	has	indeed	been	great.	I	have	lost	my
entire	family,	my	career	and	everything	I	had	in	terms	of	worldly	possessions.	I
have	also	suffered	much	in	my	physical	body.	BUT	through	it	all,	the	Lord	HAS
been	with	me	and	what	Satan	means	for	defeat	the	Lord	will	turn	into	victory.
The	road	has	indeed	been	very	long	and	rocky	since	that	first	meeting	with	Satan
and	he	has	made	my	life	an	agony	and	an	anguish	that	I	never	knew	existed,	and
I	know	also	that	there	is	more	to	come.	But,	also,	never	could	I	have	come	to
know	the	Lord	as	I	do,	and	though	I	know	I’m	just	getting	started	there,	too,
getting	to	know	Him	this	much	is	worth	anything!	I	know	at	last	the	meaning	of
Matthew	6:19-21	where	Jesus	said:
“Lay	not	up	for	yourselves	treasures	upon	earth,	where	moth	and	rust
doth	corrupt,	and	where	thieves	break	through	and	steal:	But	lay	up	for
yourselves	treasure	in	heaven,	where	neither	moth	nor	rust	doth	corrupt,
and	where	thieves	do	not	break	through	nor	steal:	For	where	your
treasure	is,	there	will	your	heart	be	also.
The	most	valuable	treasure	anyone	can	have	is	personal	knowledge	of	Jesus,	and
Father,	and	the	Holy	Spirit!

CHAPTER	12
The	Battle

REBECCA	TALKS:
The	next	chapter	in	our	lives	was	a	relentless	battle	which	lasted	for	eight	weeks.
As	I	look	back,	I	realize	that	the	Lord	was	putting	us	through	a	period	of
intensive	training,	taking	us	stage	by	stage	into	an	ever	deeper	knowledge	of
Satan’s	kingdom	and	how	to	combat	it.	I	had	very	little	awareness	of	the	spirit
world	prior	to	that	time	and	the	Lord	was	also	training	me	in	this	area.	Many
times	during	that	eight	weeks	I	asked	the	Lord	how	much	longer	the	battle	must
continue	and	always	His	answer	was,	“Until	you	have	learned	enough.”	Because
Elaine	had	been	so	very	deeply	involved	in	the	occult	there	was	much	we	had	to
learn	before	she	could	be	completely	cleared	of	the	demons.
During	the	entire	eight	week’s	period	neither	one	of	us	had	more	than	one	to	two
hours	of	broken	sleep	per	night.	I	continued	to	work	full	time	at	the	hospital,	of
course,	but	fortunately	I	was	on	a	rotation	that	did	not	require	night	call	and	was
mostly	research.	Each	morning	as	I	prepared	for	work	after	yet	another	sleepless
and	exhausting	night	I	paused	a	moment	and	quoted	Isaiah	40:31,	laying	claim	to
the	promises	there:
“But	they	that	wait	upon	the	Lord	shall	renew	their	strength;	they	shall
mount	up	with	wings	as	eagles;	they	shall	run,	and	not	be	weary;	and
they	shall	walk,	and	not	faint.”
Each	day	as	I	laid	claim	to	that	promise,	somehow,	the	Lord	gave	me	the
strength	to	keep	going	during	the	rest	of	the	day.	I	dared	tell	no	one	what	was
going	on.	There	was	no	one	who	would	understand	and	everyone	was	hostile	to
me	anyway.	My	dear	parents	were	not,	of	course,	but	I	did	not	want	to	worry
them.	So,	Elaine	and	I	battled	completely	alone	except	for	the	Lord.	Toward	the
end	of	that	period	of	time	the	Lord	instructed	me	to	read	the	book	of	Nehemiah.
There	I	discovered	the	passage	where	Nehemiah’s	enemies	threatened	to	attack
the	Jews	to	stop	the	rebuilding	of	the	wall	of	Jerusalem.	Chapter	4:21-23	says:
“So	we	labored	in	the	work:	and	half	of	them	held	the	spears	from	the
rising	of	the	morning	till	the	stars	appeared.	Likewise	all	the	same	time
said	I	unto	the	people,	Let	every	one	with	his	servant	lodge	within
Jerusalem,	that	in	the	night	they	may	be	a	guard	to	us,	and	labor	on	the
day.	So	neither	I,	nor	my	brethren,	nor	my	servants,	nor	the	men	of	the
guard	which	followed	me,	none	of	us	put	off	our	clothes,	saving	that
every	one	put	them	off	for	washing.”

Nehemiah	6:15	told	me	that	it	took	52	days	to	complete	the	wall.	I	figured	that	if
the	Lord	could	keep	Nehemiah	and	all	the	people	going	day	and	night	without
sleep	for	52	days	that	He	could	give	me	the	strength	to	keep	going	too.	That
scripture	was	a	great	comfort	to	me,	especially	as	some	people	were	telling	me
that	I	looked	tired	and	that	it	was	“My	responsibility	to	the	Lord	to	be	sure	that	I
got	adequate	rest	every	night.	The	Lord	would	not	require	otherwise.”
The	battle	took	place	simultaneously	on	three	fronts:	against	demons,	against	the
human	spirits	of	cult	members	and	against	physical	people	from	The
Brotherhood	who	were	sent	to	try	to	kill	us.
The	battle	began	a	week	after	Elaine’s	first	deliverance.	I	had	just	talked	to
Pastor	Pat	that	afternoon	as	described	in	the	preceding	chapter.	He	had
counseled	me	not	to	try	to	deal	with	any	demons	by	myself	as	he	was	afraid	that
they	might	be	too	strong	for	me.	Elaine	had	started	having	chest	pain	again	that
day	but	had	not	told	me.
That	evening	after	the	pastor	left	she	had	another	severe	episode	of	chest	pain.	I
will	never	forget	how	down	and	discouraged	we	were	as	we	sat	on	the	couch	in
my	living	room	afterwards.	I	turned	to	Elaine	and	said,
“Elaine	that	pain	must	have	been	from	a	demon.	They	must	be	back	again.	Why
didn’t	you	say	something	earlier	when	Pastor	Pat	was	here?”
Of	course,	what	I	did	not	know	then,	was	that	the	demons	had	blocked	Elaine
from	saying	anything	when	the	pastor	was	there.	We	both	sat	in	silence	for	a	few
minutes.	Then	Elaine’s	voice	said,
“Well,	I’m	not	going	to	be	defeated	a	second	time!”
“But	Elaine,	when	were	you	defeated	the	first	time?”
No	answer.	So	I	reached	over	to	touch	her	arm	to	get	her	attention.	She	jumped
and	turned	to	me,	her	face	contorted	into	a	snarl,	hands	reaching	for	my	throat.
Instantly	I	realized	that	I	had	not	been	talking	to	Elaine	but	to	a	demon	in	her.	I
jumped	back	out	of	reach,	passing	my	hand	in	front	of	me	exclaiming:
“I	put	a	shield	of	faith	in	Jesus	between	you	and	me,	you	may	not	touch	me,
demon!”
A	harsh	guttural	voice	said,	“My	name	is	Legion.	I	am	going	to	kill	you!	There
is	only	one	of	you	now	and	not	more	than	four	hours	ago	your	own	pastor	told
you	not	to	try	to	take	us	on	yourself,	you’re	not	strong	enough.	Now	that	you’re
alone,	I’m	going	to	kill	you!	You	have	interfered	with	Satan’s	bride	long

alone,	I’m	going	to	kill	you!	You	have	interfered	with	Satan’s	bride	long
enough.”
I	don’t	think	I	have	ever	been	so	frightened	in	my	entire	life.	I	felt	overwhelmed
with	the	presence	of	evil	in	that	room.	I	knew	only	too	well	that	the	demon	had
been	listening	to	every	word	of	my	conversation	with	Pastor	Pat	earlier	that	day.
He	knew	of	my	depression	and	discouragement	as	well.	Instinctively	I	also	knew
that	I	dared	not	let	him	see	how	afraid	I	was.	I	had	no	doubt	that	if	I	let	him	get
the	upperhand	that	he	would	indeed	kill	me.	Elaine’s	body	was	much	stronger
than	mine	to	start	with	and	I	had	no	doubt	that	under	complete	demonic	control
it	would	be	many	times	stronger.	I	swallowed	hard	and	answered	in	what	I
hoped	was	a	commanding	voice.
“Oh	no,	demon,	Elaine	is	no	longer	Satan’s	bride.	You	are	the	trespasser.	I	may
be	alone,	but	Jesus	IS	with	me	and	it	is	His	power	that	will	overcome	you,	not
mine.	I	don’t	have	to	be	stronger	than	you	because	Jesus	already	is.”
“You	don’t	know	what	you’re	talking	about.	I’m	going	to	enjoy	watching	you
squirm	as	I	strangle	you	to	death.	Just	watch!”
As	he	spoke	he	reached	out	for	me	again.	Again	I	passed	my	hand	in	front	of	me
and	laid	claim	to	the	shield	of	faith	in	Jesus.	Much	to	my	joy	the	demon	had	to
stop	short.	There	was	an	invisible	barrier	between	him	and	me	and	he	could	not
reach	through	it,	hard	as	he	tried.	He	became	very	angry	as	I	praised	the	Lord	for
His	faithfulness	in	protecting	me.
The	battle	went	on	for	45	minutes.	I	prayed,	sang	hymns,	read	and	quoted
scripture.	Over	and	over	again	I	commanded	the	demon	to	come	out.	Many
times	he	tried	to	use	Elaine’s	body	to	harm	me	physically	but	always	he	was
stopped	as	I	steadily	claimed	that	protecting	shield.
The	Holy	Spirit	brought	scripture	after	scripture	to	my	mind.	I	quoted	Luke
10:19,	Job	30:2-8	and	Colossians	2:15	to	him	repeatedly	which	tormented	him.	I
read	from	Revelation	chapter	18	about	the	fall	of	Babylon,	telling	him	that	he,
too,	was	falling	in	that	very	hour.	He	shouted	at	me,	cursed	me,	threatened	and
finally	began	to	cajole	me	to	leave	him	alone;	but	I	pushed	my	advantage.	At
last,	with	a	scream	of	rage	he	came	out	of	Elaine	in	an	episode	of	violent
coughing.
I	was	so	relieved	and	unnerved	that	I	burst	into	tears.	Poor	Elaine,	she	had	been
unconscious	all	that	time.	She	could	not	understand	why	I	was	crying	so
uncontrollably.	I	was	shaking	from	head	to	toe,	I	had	been	so	frightened.	But	as	I
sat	there	telling	Elaine	what	had	happened,	the	realization	filled	my	soul	that

Jesus	had	been	faithful	and	had	indeed	given	me	His	own	power	and	authority
over	those	foul	things.	Scared	as	I	had	been,	Jesus	had	stood	firm	and	had
delivered	me	out	of	the	hand	of	my	enemy.	Elaine	felt	much	better	after	Legion
was	out	and	we	went	to	bed	for	our	last	night	of	sleep	for	the	following	eight
weeks.
The	following	days	and	nights	blurred	together	as	demon	after	demon	came	into
Elaine	to	try	to	kill	her,	or	me,	or	both	of	us.	The	battle	was	continuous	and
unrelenting.	Fortunately	the	hospital	was	only	a	two	minute’s	drive	from	my
home.	Many	times	during	the	day	the	Lord	would	speak	to	me	urgently
instructing	me	to	hurry	home,	that	Elaine	was	in	trouble.	Always	I	would	arrive
home	to	find	her	on	the	floor	unconscious,	often	with	a	belt	around	her	throat,
blue	from	lack	of	oxygen.	Her	own	hands	were	under	the	control	of	a	demon
pulling	the	belt	so	tight	that	she	could	not	breath.	Sometimes	she	would	be
bleeding	from	a	cut,	knife	still	in	hand.	Sometimes	in	a	coma	so	deep	that	she
was	hardly	breathing.	Sometimes	being	strangled	with	her	own	hands	as	the
demons	sought	to	crush	her	larynx	(voice	box).	I	know	that	it	was	a	direct
provision	of	the	Lord	that	I	was	on	a	rotation	which	was	mostly	study	so	I	was
free	to	run	back	and	forth	from	the	hospital.
The	next	day	after	my	first	meeting	with	Legion,	the	Lord	spoke	to	me	and	gave
me	the	scripture	in	II	Timothy	1:14	which	says:
“That	good	thing	which	was	committed	unto	thee	keep	by	the	Holy
Ghost	which	dwelleth	in	us.”
The	Lord	showed	me	that	Elaine	was	the	good	deposit	given	to	me	—	that	I	must
guard	her	diligently	with	my	very	life.
As	the	battle	grew	rapidly	I	became	most	concerned	as	to	why	the	demons	that
were	cast	out	could	come	back	into	Elaine	again	in	a	very	short	time.	As	I
prayerfully	considered	the	situation	the	Lord	brought	to	my	mind	a	passage	from
a	book	I	had	read	some	months	before.	It	is	called	The	Conquest	Of	Canaan,	by
Jessie	Penn-Lewis.	She	wrote:
“Galatians	5:24	is	also	a	passage	which	meets	the	case	just	here:	‘They
that	are	Christ’s	have	crucified	the	flesh	with	the	affections	and	lusts.’
This	is	judicially	the	position	of	all	the	children	of	God,	but	it	must	be
experimental	also.	For	in	this	spiritual	battle,	unless	the	knife	is	applied
to	what	the	scriptures	term	the	‘flesh,’	it	will	always	be	ground	for	the
enemy	to	attack,	so	as	to	weaken	us	in	the	conflict.	The	‘flesh’	must	be
kept	under	the	knife	of	the	cross,	for	if	there	is	any	self-indulgence,	or
anything	that	is	doubtful	in	your	life,	and	you	venture	to	take	the

anything	that	is	doubtful	in	your	life,	and	you	venture	to	take	the
aggressive	against	the	foe,	the	enemy	will	come	back	on	you,	and	—
fastening	on	that	uncrucified	’ground’	in	you	—	will	press	you	with
appalling	power.	You	must	have	the	knife	of	the	cross	steadily,
persistently,	and	unbrokenly	applied	to	the	flesh;	to	the	appetites	of	the
flesh,	to	self-indulgence	in	any	form,	and	to	the	pride	of	the	flesh.”	page
9.
As	I	sat	pondering	and	praying	about	this	passage	as	to	how	it	might	apply	to	our
current	situation	with	the	demons	in	Elaine,	the	Lord	suddenly	flashed	a	clear
picture	into	my	mind	which	the	Holy	Spirit	confirmed	to	me	was	a	spiritual
vision.	In	the	vision,	Elaine	was	standing	in	the	center	of	a	ring	of	circling
animals	that	looked	like	huge	and	vicious	cats.	They	were	very	ugly.	They	were
circling	around	and	around	her,	sniffing,	sniffing.	Suddenly	one	of	them	stopped,
sniffed	and	then	jumped	right	into	her.	Then	I	understood.
The	cat-like	animals	represented	demons.	They	were	circling	around	Elaine
continuously	trying	to	find	an	opening	or	doorway	to	get	in.	When	they	did,	they
jumped	into	her	and	almost	immediately	manifested	to	me.	I	told	Elaine	about
the	vision,	and	showed	her	the	passage	in	the	book.	I	felt	led	by	the	Lord	that	she
needed	to	ask	Him	to	search	her	and	reveal	to	her	any	open	doorways	in	her	life
that	needed	to	be	closed	by	confession,	forgiveness	and	the	blood	of	Jesus.	I
greatly	admire	her	courage	and	persistence.
She	went	through	two	days	and	nights	of	intense	searching.	I’m	sure	it	was	a
terribly	painful	experience	for	her.	The	vision	was	in	my	conscious	awareness
continuously	during	that	time.	Everytime	one	of	the	animals	jumped	into	Elaine
immediately	a	demon	would	surface	and	the	battle	would	be	on	until	it	was	cast
out.	Then	followed	a	time	of	waiting	prayerfully	on	the	Lord	to	reveal	to	Elaine
or	myself	the	doorway	it	had	used.	Steadily,	door	after	door	was	closed	as	Elaine
confessed	particular	involvements	or	sins,	received	forgiveness	and	then	asked
the	Lord	to	close	that	door	forever	with	His	blood.	Finally,	about	2	A.M.	on	a
Monday	morning,	I	suddenly	realized	that	the	“animals”	were	circling	in	the
opposite	direction.	I	exclaimed	in	surprise:
“Elaine,	why	are	they	going	in	the	opposite	direction	now?”
“Why	is	what	going	in	the	opposite	direction?”
I	petitioned	Father	to	let	Elaine	see	the	vision	too,	which	He	did	immediately.
She	was	thoughtful	for	awhile.	Then,
“I	suppose	because	they	can	no	longer	find	any	doors	the	way	they	were	going.”

“I	suppose	because	they	can	no	longer	find	any	doors	the	way	they	were	going.”
Even	as	she	spoke,	both	of	us	saw	one	of	the	demons	stand	up	on	its	hind	legs
and	paw	against	what	seemed	to	be	an	invisible	barrier.
“Elaine!”	I	cried	out,	“We	must	close	the	top!”
But	I	was	too	late.	The	demon	had	jumped	up	and	over	the	invisible	barrier	into
the	obviously	open	top	and	Elaine	was	in	a	deep	coma.	She	was	under	the
control	of	a	pair	of	demons	called	Coma	and	Endless	Sleep.	These	two	gave	me
untold	trouble!	They	were	very	powerful	and	they	would	put	Elaine	into	a	coma
so	deep	that	her	heart	rate	would	slow	down	to	30	per	minute	or	so	and	she
would	sometimes	stop	breathing.	They	were	also	very	hard	to	deal	with	because
they	would	not	speak	to	me	and	they	could	seemingly	not	hear	me	because
Elaine’s	body	was	in	such	a	deep	coma.
This	time	was	no	different.	I	feared	for	her	life.	Nothing	worked.	I	prayed,	sang
hymns,	shouted	at	them,	slapped	Elaine’s	cheek.	Nothing	but	a	deeper	coma.
Finally	in	desperation,	not	knowing	what	else	to	do,	I	picked	up	my	Bible	and
began	to	read	aloud	from	the	book	of	Revelation.	Demons	hate	that	book.	I	read
and	read,	my	heart	sinking	within	me,	but	standing	in	faith	that	the	Lord	would
save	Elaine’s	life.	When	I	had	read	about	half	way	through	the	book	the	demon
suddenly	reached	out	with	Elaine’s	hand	and	tried	to	tear	the	Bible	away	from
me.
“Shut-up!”	he	snarled.	“We	can’t	stand	to	hear	any	more	of	that.”
“Too	bad,	demon,	that	book	tells	of	your	final	down-fall	and	total	destruction.	If
you	hang	around,	I’ll	read	the	rest	of	it	to	you.	I’ll	read	it	over	and	over	again,
and	what’s	more,	I’ll	ask	Father	to	prevent	you	from	stopping	your	ears	so	you
can’t	hear	me.	You’ll	have	to	listen	to	it,	I	know	He’ll	make	you.”
“You	can’t	do	that.”
“Oh	yes	I	can!”	And	then	I	prayed	aloud	and	asked	Father	to	make	those	demons
hear	every	word	I	read.	I	started	reading	again.	The	response	was	prompt.
“Shut-up!!”	The	demon	was	so	frustrated	that	he	was	screaming	at	me.	Of	course
I	refused	and	finally	he	had	to	come	out.	I	had	discovered	a	key	in	handling
these	difficult	demons.	I	could	ask	Father	to	do	things	to	them,	such	as	make
them	hear,	and	He	would.
The	top	doorway	was	difficult	to	close	as	it	involved	an	area	that	was	dear	to
Elaine’s	heart.	But	her	courage	and	commitment	to	the	Lord	prevailed	and	at	last
it	was	closed.	Almost	immediately	in	the	vision	I	saw	one	of	the	“animals”

it	was	closed.	Almost	immediately	in	the	vision	I	saw	one	of	the	“animals”
digging	at	the	ground	at	Elaine’s	feet.
“Oh	NO!	The	bottom!”	Again	I	was	too	late.	The	demon	was	in.	I	had	another
hour’s	battle	before	that	one	was	cast	out.	Elaine	and	I	began	asking	the	Lord	to
reveal	the	bottom	doorway.	The	Lord	revealed	it	to	both	of	us	at	the	same	time.
Pride.	Again,	I	was	to	run	into	Elaine’s	stubbornness	as	I	had	in	the	first	incident
with	Mann-Chan.	Up	to	that	point,	Elaine	had	steadfastly	refused	to	get	down	on
her	knees	to	pray.	The	Lord	had	dealt	with	me	on	this	subject	some	years	before.
It	is	humbling	to	get	down	on	your	knees,	but	I	had	learned	also	what	a	comfort
it	is.	There	were	other	areas	under	pride	as	well,	but	they	seemed	to	focus	in	that
one	issue	at	the	moment.	I	told	Elaine	that	I	thought	that	the	Lord	was	asking	her
to	simply	get	down	on	her	knees	and	ask	Him	to	forgive	and	deal	with	her	pride.
She	flatly	refused.	I	was	so	frustrated	as	with	each	refusal	another	demon	got	in
and	I	had	an	hour	or	so	battle	with	each	before	it	finally	came	out.	Finally,	I	got
out	the	book	The	Conquest	Of	Canaan	and	made	Elaine	read	aloud	the	passage	I
mentioned	earlier.	Then	I	told	her:
“Now,	go	into	the	living	room	and	settle	the	issue	with	the	Lord.	Don’t	come
back	until	you	do!”
I	do	not	know,	and	never	asked,	what	transpired	between	Elaine	and	the	Lord	in
the	dark	living	room	at	about	5	A.M.	that	morning,	but	as	Elaine	returned	to	me
somewhat	sheepishly,	she	had	a	peace	about	her	that	I	had	not	seen	before.
Instantly	we	both	“saw”	the	completed	work.	An	incredibly	beautiful	shining
cylinder	of	light.	It	hung	in	the	room,	filling	it	with	its	brilliant	warm,	lovely
light.	I	saw	the	demon-animals	fleeing	into	the	shadows.	We	both	sat	down	and
basked	in	the	warmth	and	light	from	the	cylinder	as	if	it	were	the	noon	sun.	We
did	not	realize	it	at	the	time,	but	we	were	seeing	and	feeling	the	glory	of	Jesus	as
that	part	of	His	work	in	Elaine’s	life	was	finished.
We	did	not	actually	see	the	cylinder	and	its	light	with	our	physical	eyes,	but
were	seeing	it	in	our	minds	through	our	spirits	as	the	vision	was	given	to	us	by
the	Holy	Spirit.	However	we	also	experienced	the	warmth	and	love	radiating
from	it	in	our	physical	bodies.	(See	chapter	14.)	We	both	fell	asleep	for	the	first
time	in	four	days.	One	hour	later,	as	I	got	up	to	go	to	work,	I	was	delighted	to
“see”	that	the	light-cylinder	was	still	there.	Its	warmth	and	shining	love	was	a
tremendous	comfort	to	both	of	us.	I	thought	that	the	battle	was	finished	then.
How	wrong	I	was,	I	didn’t	realize	this	represented	only	one	part	of	the	work	to
be	done	of	clearing	Elaine’s	life.
I	was	dismayed	when	I	came	home	that	afternoon	to	find	Elaine	on	the	couch,

I	was	dismayed	when	I	came	home	that	afternoon	to	find	Elaine	on	the	couch,
blue,	not	breathing,	belt	around	her	neck,	her	own	hands	under	demonic	control
pulling	it	tight	so	that	she	could	not	breath.	I	was	broken	hearted	as	I	dealt	with
the	demon	that	was	trying	to	kill	her.	How	could	this	be?	I	still	saw	the
completed	shining	cylinder	in	my	spirit.	How	then	could	yet	another	demon	have
gotten	in?	Again	and	again	that	evening	demons	got	in,	always	catching	me
unawares.	I	couldn’t	accept	that	they	were	getting	in.	I	was	so	exhausted	and	I
had	been	relying	on	the	cylinder	as	a	sign	that	they	could	not	get	in	anymore.
Finally,	with	many	tears,	I	prayed	and	asked	the	Lord	to	remove	the	vision	as	I
realized	that	I	was	depending	on	it	instead	of	the	Lord,	and	therefore	Satan	was
able	to	use	it	to	manipulate	me.	Even	as	I	asked,	instantly	the	lovely	lightcylinder	vanished.	That	evening	we	entered	a	new	area	of	battle.
I	was	in	the	kitchen	fixing	dinner	when	Elaine	came	under	the	control	of	what	I
thought	was	a	demon.	I	realized	she	was	in	the	kitchen	when	I	was	stabbed	in	the
back	with	the	large	knife	I	had	been	using	to	cut	up	the	meat.	I	grabbed	her	hand
saying:
“No,	demon,	I	bind	you	in	the	name	of	Jesus.	You	will	give	me	the	knife.”
I	was	surprised	to	hear	a	very	feminine	voice	answer	me.
“You	can’t	order	me	around	like	some	demon!	I	don’t	have	to	obey	you	and
your	stupid	commands	because	I’M	NOT	a	demon!	Now	I’m	going	to	teach	you
both	a	lesson.”
An	all-out	wrestling	match	ensued	during	which	I	received	a	number	of	rather
severe	cuts.	Blood	was	all	over	the	kitchen.	As	I	struggled	for	both	the	knife	and
our	lives	I	keep	saying,
“I	don’t	care	who	or	what	you	are,	I	will	defeat	you	in	the	name	and	power	of
Jesus.”	At	last	I	managed	to	wrest	the	knife	out	of	her	hand.	Panting	and	at	the
end	of	my	strength,	I	forced	her	to	sit	in	a	chair.
“Now,	I	command	you	in	the	name	of	Jesus,	to	tell	me	who,	and	what	you	are!”
“I	am	Sally.”
I	was	surprised.	I	knew	that	Sally	had	been	a	friend	of	Elaine’s	and	the	witch
whom	Elaine	had	been	tutoring.	She	became	Elaine’s	successor	as	high
priestess.	She	was	more	arrogant	that	any	demon	I	had	run	into	and	just	as
deadly.	I	could	feel	her	hatred.
“Well,	Sally,	human	or	demon,	you	will	bow	your	knee	to	Jesus.	You	have	no

choice,	you	know,	because	God’s	word	says	so.	In	Philippians	2:6-11	God	says:
‘Who,	being	in	the	form	of	God,	thought	it	not	robbery	to	be	equal	with
God:	But	made	himself	of	no	reputation,	and	took	upon	him	the	form	of	a
servant,	and	was	made	in	the	likeness	of	men:	And	being	found	in
fashion	as	a	man,	he	humbled	himself,	and	became	obedient	unto	death,
even	the	death	of	the	cross.	Wherefore	God	also	hath	highly	exalted	him,
and	given	him	a	name	which	is	above	every	name:	That	at	the	name	of
Jesus	every	knee	should	bow,	of	things	in	heaven,	and	things	in	earth,
and	things	under	the	earth;	And	that	every	tongue	should	confess	that
Jesus	Christ	is	Lord,	to	the	glory	of	God	the	Father.’”
As	I	quoted	those	beautiful	verses	I	felt	the	Lord	strengthening	my	body.
“So	you	see,	Sally,	you	have	no	choice.	The	fact	that	you	are	human	and	not
demon	makes	no	difference.	Your	knee,	too,	must	bow	to	Jesus.”
She	laughed	mockingly	at	me.	“You	think	your	so	called	Jesus	is	so	great.	That
is	all	a	bunch	of	lies.	I	will	never	bow	to	Him!”
I	was	absolutely	filled	with	rage!	Without	thinking,	I	reached	out	and	grabbed
her	by	the	shoulders,	literally	lifted	her	out	of	the	chair,	and	pushed	her	down	on
the	floor	on	her	knees.	Then	I	put	my	hand	on	the	back	or	her	head	and	pushed
her	nose	to	the	floor.
“Now	what	do	you	think	of	your	fine	statements	that	you’ll	never	bow	to	Jesus?!
That’s	exactly	what	you’re	doing	now,	because	He	is	standing	right	here!”
I’m	not	sure	who	was	more	surprised,	Sally	or	me.	Elaine	is	not	exactly	light	and
I	was	already	exhausted	from	our	frantic	struggle	over	the	knife	a	few	moments
before.	I	let	Sally	bring	poor	Elaine’s	nose	up	off	the	floor,	but	continued	to	hold
her	on	her	knees.
“Sally,	you	must	see.	Satan	is	lying	to	you,	just	as	he	lied	to	Elaine.	Jesus	is	the
victor,	not	Satan.	Satan	wants	only	to	destroy	you.	If	he	were	the	stronger	as	he
claims,	then	why	are	you	on	the	floor	instead	of	me?	Sally,	your	only	hope	is	to
commit	your	life	to	Jesus!”
“I’m	not	listening	to	you	any	longer,	but	I’ll	be	back	and	you	both	will	be
sorry!”	Instantly	she	was	gone	and	Elaine’s	unconscious	body	sagged	against
me.	Then	she	roused	and	looked	up	at	me.
“Hey,	what’s	going	on,	why	am	I	on	the	floor	—	is	this	another	lesson	in
humility?”

I	laughed	a	bit	shakenly,	dusting	off	the	end	of	Elaine’s	nose.
“I’m	sorry,	but	I’m	afraid	I	forgot	for	a	moment	that	it	was	your	body,	I	was	so
mad	at	Sally.”
“AT	WHO?!!”
“At	Sally.	She	was	insulting	about	Jesus	and	declared	that	she	would	never	bow
her	knee	to	Him,	and,	well,	I	made	her.”
“So	I	see.	But	what	was	she	trying	to	do?”
“Kill	both	of	us	with	the	butcher	knife.”
“Oh	boy!	Well	she	didn’t	succeed	I	see,	though	I’ve	certainly	seen	you	looking
better.”
As	Elaine	helped	me	to	clean	up	both	myself	and	the	kitchen	I	asked	her:
“Elaine,	did	you	used	to	do	things	like	that,	enter	into	another	person’s	body	and
move	and	talk	through	them,	I	mean?”
“Sure,	that	was	simple.”
“Were	you	consciously	aware	of	what	you	were	doing	and	what	was	said	and
done?”
“Yes.”
“But	how	did	you	do	it?	I	think	maybe	this	is	another	doorway.	How	else	could
she	have	gotten	in?”
“I	really	don’t	know	how	I	did	it,	I	just	did	it.	It	was	one	of	the	first	things	I
learned	to	do.	As	I	grew	in	power,	I	could	leave	my	body	and	go	anywhere	and
do	anything	I	wanted,	ail	the	while	still	being	consciously	aware	of	what	was
happening	and	what	I	was	doing	with	my	physical	body	too.”
Suddenly	something	clicked.	The	Holy	Spirit	brought	back	to	my	memory	a
book	I	had	read	over	a	year	before.	Excitedly	I	ran	to	my	bookshelf	to	get	it.	I
told	Elaine	I	thought	it	might	contain	the	answer	to	our	dilemma.	It	talked	about
“soul-power”	which	is	really	the	power	in	the	human	spirit	body	when	under	the
control	of	the	soul.	There	are	two	books	that	deal	with	this	subject.	The	Latent
Power	Of	The	Soul,	by	Watchman	Nee,	and	Soul	And	Spirit,	by	Jessie	PennLewis.	Over	the	next	two	days	Elaine	and	I	read	aloud	together	through	the
entire	book	The	Latent	Power	Of	The	Soul.

We	both	began	to	understand	just	what	the	strange	power	was	that	Elaine	had
used	in	addition	to	demons	for	so	many	years.	Satan	never	teaches	his	people
what	they	are	using,	just	how	to	use	the	power	within	them.	(The	topic	of	the
control	of	the	human	spirit	by	the	soul	will	be	explained	more	fully	in	chapter
14.)	Elaine	had	been	consciously	controlling	her	spirit	body.
As	we	learned	about	human	spirits,	I	began	to	get	to	know	many	of	the	witches
and	warlocks	of	the	area	as	various	ones	of	them	came	into	Elaine	with	their
spirit	body	to	try	to	kill	both	of	us.	One	of	the	most	troublesome	of	them	was
code-named	David,	the	high	priest	of	the	large	and	powerful	coven	in	the	city	in
which	we	lived.	He	was	a	physician	at	the	hospital	where	I	was	training	and	he
told	me	that	he	had	sworn	to	kill	me	at	any	cost.	The	human	spirits	were	much
more	difficult	to	fight	than	the	demons	as	they	had	no	respect	at	all	for	God.	I
was	reminded	of	James	2:19,	“Even	the	devils	believe	and	tremble.”	and	of	Jude
8-13:
“Likewise	also	these	filthy	dreamers	defile	the	flesh,	despise	dominion,
and	speak	evil	of	dignities.	Yet	Michael	the	archangel	when	contending
with	the	devil	he	disputed	about	the	body	of	Moses,	durst	not	bring
against	him	a	railing	accusation,	but	said,	‘The	Lord	rebuke	thee.’
But	these	speak	evil	of	those	thing	which	they	know	not;	but	what	they
know	naturally	as	brute	beasts,	in	those	things	they	corrupt	themselves.
Woe	unto	them!	...	carried	about	of	winds;	trees	whose	fruit	withereth,
without	fruit,	twice	dead,	plucked	up	by	the	roots;	raging	waves	of	the
sea	foaming	out	their	own	shame;	wandering	stars,	to	whom	is	reserved
the	blackness	of	darkness	for	ever.”
No	matter	how	desperate	the	battle,	the	Lord	always	gave	me	the	physical
strength	I	needed.	As	we	read	and	learned,	the	Lord	began	steadily	impressing
upon	me	that	Elaine	must	give	up	entirely	all	of	her	ability	to	control	her	spirit
body	with	her	soul.	He	revealed	to	me	that	she	had	been	using	it	to	fight	with	all
along.	At	last	I	began	to	understand	what	had	been	going	on	during	her	time	as	a
patient	at	the	hospital.	She	and	the	nurses	had	been	having	witchcraft	duels
under	my	nose	and	I	hadn’t	known	it.	The	pieces	of	the	puzzle	began	to	fit
together.	No	wonder	the	nurses	had	all	been	so	hostile.	Elaine	had	been	winning
every	time!
It	was	then	that	Elaine	faced	one	of	the	severest	tests	of	her	commitment	to
Christ.	The	conscious	control	of	her	own	spirit	body	not	only	permitted	her	to
use	it,	but	she	was	also	able	to	see	and	communicate	with	the	spirit	world
whenever	she	wanted.	This,	of	course,	permitted	her	to	see	by	her	spirit

whenever	she	wanted.	This,	of	course,	permitted	her	to	see	by	her	spirit
whenever	an	attack	was	coming.	At	the	Lord’s	guidance	I	told	her	that	I	thought
that	the	only	way	that	the	doorway	for	human	spirits	could	be	closed	was	for	her
to	ask	the	Lord	to	take	away	all	of	her	power	and	abilities	of	witchcraft	and	the
control	of	her	spirit	body.	To	take	it	all	away	so	completely	that	even	if	she	were
to	rebel	and	decide	to	use	it	again	that	she	would	be	unable	to	do	so.
Elaine	agonized	over	this	decision	for	the	better	part	of	the	day.	She	knew	only
too	well	that	to	give	up	all	of	her	power	left	her	completely	defenseless	against
the	many	who	were	trying	to	torture	and	kill	her.	She	would	then	be	totally
dependent	upon	the	Lord.	But	her	love	for,	and	commitment	to	the	Lord	won
through	and	that	evening	another	big	step	was	taken	as	Elaine	and	I	knelt
together	and	she	prayed	asking	the	Lord	to	take	away	all	of	her	powers	and	to
sever	between	her	soul	and	spirit	as	in	Hebrews	4:12.
That	night	another	important	lesson	was	learned.	I	had	just	drifted	off	to	sleep
when	suddenly	the	Lord	awakened	me	and	I	ran	into	the	bedroom	to	find	Elaine
sitting	up	in	bed	under	the	control	of	a	demon.	The	demon	was	pointing	with
hand	and	arm	outstretched.	As	the	Lord	enabled	me	to	hear	his	guttural,
muttered	words	I	was	horrified	to	realize	that	he	was	using	Elaine’s	spirit	body
and	directing	it	at	Sally	in	an	effort	to	kill	her.	Immediately	I	reached	over	and
passed	my	hand	up	and	down	in	front	of	the	demon’s	pointing	finger	saying:
“NO	demon,	I	block	you	with	the	power	of	the	name	of	Jesus!	You	no	longer
have	any	right	to	use	Elaine’s	spirit	because	she	has	asked	the	Lord	to	seal	it.”
How	thankful	I	was	that	she	had	taken	that	important	step.	Otherwise	the	demon
would	have	had	legal	right	to	use	it.
Furious,	he	turned	on	me	screaming	in	rage.	“How	dare	you	stop	me	!	Her	spirit
belongs	to	me,	I	will	use	it	as	I	please.”
“No	demon,	you	can’t.	It	is	now	under	the	blood	of	Jesus	and	sealed	off	from
anyone’s	use	forever.	Now	go!	I	command	you	in	the	name	of	Jesus.”
He	drew	back,	eyes	glaring	pure	hatred.	“I,	Yahshun,	the	prince	will	return
again,	I	will	kill	you	for	what	you	have	done	tonight!”	With	those	words	he	left.
As	he	left	Elaine’s	body	sagged	against	me,	then	she	returned	to	consciousness.	I
told	her	of	the	incident	and	how	Yahshun	had	been	trying	to	use	her	spirit.
“Tell	me,	Elaine,	did	the	demons	use	your	spirit	like	that	before	you	turned	to
Jesus?”
“Oh,	yes,	often.	I	could	not	stop	them.	I	was	disciplined	many	times	for	trying	to
do	so.	Yahshun	is	a	very	high	demon.	He	and	other	demons	like	him	use	the

do	so.	Yahshun	is	a	very	high	demon.	He	and	other	demons	like	him	use	the
spirits	of	cult	members	as	they	please.	Often	this	results	in	much	weakness	and
sickness	for	the	person.	Satan	never	asks,	he	just	takes!”
Later	that	night	I	awakened	abruptly	as	Elaine’s	hands,	under	the	control	of
Yahshun,	closed	about	my	throat.	(I	was	so	exhausted	I	had	just	dropped	off	to
sleep	and	had	not	heard	Elaine	come	into	the	room.)	I	struggled	frantically	to
loosen	the	steel-like	fingers	that	were	strangling	me.	The	Lord	gave	me	strength
as	I	silently	cried	out	to	Him.	Somehow,	I	managed	to	break	his	grip	just	before
passing	out	from	lack	of	oxygen.	We	rolled	all	over	the	bed	and	down	onto	the
floor,	locked	in	desperate	battle.	Waves	of	fear	swept	over	me.	Gasping	for
breath,	I	kept	saying:	“I	will	defeat	you	in	the	name	of	Jesus.	You	will	leave
now!”
He	fought	desperately,	cursing,	and	threatening.	But	I	kept	commanding	him	to
go	in	the	name	and	authority	of	Jesus	and	finally	with	one	last	enraged	shriek	he
left.	Instantly	there	was	a	great	quietness	and	a	peace	in	the	room	such	as	we	had
not	experienced	since	the	first	appearance	of	the	light-cylinder.	As	always,	the
Lord	had	given	me	the	strength	that	I	needed.	But	the	wounds	I	had	received
took	several	weeks	to	heal.	My	larynx	was	damaged	so	that	I	had	difficulty
speaking	for	some	weeks.
Again	we	both	breathed	a	sigh	of	relief	thinking	that	our	troubles	with	the
doorway	for	human	spirits	were	over.	How	wrong	we	were.	Over	the	next
couple	of	days	repeatedly	the	spirits	of	the	various	witches	and	warlocks	came	to
torment	us.	After	much	prayer	and	searching	we	realized	that	there	were	three
levels	of	the	soul	which	controlled	the	spirit	-	the	conscious,	sub-conscious	and	a
deep	third	unconscious	level	(these	are,	or	course,	the	three	levels	in	the	mind).
It	is	this	third	unconscious	level	that	the	demons	make	so	much	use	of.	Elaine
had	to	ask	the	Lord	to	deal	with	all	three	levels	of	control	of	her	spirit	by	her
soul.	As	she	did	this	she	was	sealed	by	the	Lord.	Neither	she	nor	any	demon	or
other	person	has	been	able	to	use	her	spirit	body	or	enter	her	through	that
doorway	from	that	day	on.
During	the	course	of	our	battling	I	became	more	and	more	aware	not	only	of	the
spirit	world	but	of	God’s	angels	as	well.	One	night	shortly	after	the	struggle	with
Yahshun	I	was	particularly	ill	and	exhausted	and	much	weaker	than	usual.	The
demons	saw	this	and	became	much	more	aggressive	in	their	physical	attack.	As
one	of	the	demons	came	to	the	surface,	reaching	for	my	throat,	bragging	that	he
was	stronger	than	the	rest,	the	Holy	Spirit	commanded	me:
“Do	not	resist,	I	will	take	care	of	this	one.”

Immediately	I	obeyed,	hoping	fervently	that	I	had	heard	the	Lord	correctly	as	the
demon’s	hands,	controlling	Elaine’s	body,	began	to	close	about	my	neck.
Suddenly,	one-by-one,	his	fingers	were	pulled	off	my	throat.	Then	his	hands
pulled	away	from	me,	pulled	down,	and	his	hands	and	arms	crossed	in	front	of
him	and	held	firm;	rendering	him	helpless.	I	could	not	see	the	force	holding	the
demon’s	hands,	but	he	was	obviously	struggling	with	something,	cursing	loudly.
As	his	arms	were	held	firm	despite	all	of	his	protests,	he	looked	at	me	and
snarled:
“Get	those	angels	off	of	me,	they	are	hurting	me!”
With	great	joy	I	praised	the	Lord	for	His	provision,	and	gleefully	told	the	demon,
“Oh,	no,	demon,	they	are	not	mine	to	command.	Only	the	Lord	gives	them
orders.	If	you	want	them	to	set	you	free,	you	must	ask	Jesus,	not	me.”
That	demon	left	almost	at	once.	During	the	next	several	days	I	received	help
from	the	angels	over	and	over	again.	Sometimes	the	demons	would	address	the
angels	by	name.	Sometimes	they	would	snarl	an	answer	to	a	question	that	I
could	not	hear	with	my	physical	ears,	but	had	obviously	come	from	one	of	the
angels.	More	than	once,	a	demon’s	hand	would	be	stopped	in	mid-air	as	he	tried
to	hit	me.	I	received	great	comfort	and	encouragement	from	the	realization	that
the	angels	were	there.
One	night	about	half-way	through	the	eight-weeks	of	battling,	a	new	direction
was	given	to	us	by	God.	It	was	about	3	A.M.	I	had	been	battling	with	the	demons
in	Elaine	continuously	since	arriving	home	from	work	that	afternoon.	Exhausted,
Elaine	had	just	dropped	off	to	sleep	and	I	was	sitting	on	the	couch,	knees	drawn
up,	chin	resting	on	my	knees,	arms	about	them,	pondering	the	events	of	the
battle	of	that	night.	The	demons	were	becoming	much	stronger	and	harder	to
deal	with	and	I	was	growing	much	weaker	physically.	I	had	been	very	concerned
about	this	and	had,	for	the	past	week	been	asking	Father	to	reveal	to	me	what
else	I	could	do	to	gain	strength	against	the	demons.
Suddenly,	I	felt	a	“presence”	on	the	couch	next	to	me	although	no	sound	had
been	made.	I	jumped	and	looked	up.	There	on	the	couch	next	to	me	sat	the	tallest
and	most	powerfully	built	young	man	I	had	ever	seen.	I	knew	immediately	that
this	man	was	not	a	human.
He	had	shining	golden	hair,	deep	blue	eyes	and	the	most	beautiful	smile	I	have
ever	seen.	He	was	clean	shaven	and	deep	creases	slashed	his	cheeks	as	he	smiled
at	me.	He	was	dressed	in	shining	white	with	a	golden	belt	and	a	huge	sword	at
his	side.	His	tunic-like	top	was	trimmed	with	gold	braid	which	I	had	no	doubt
was	made	of	pure	gold.	He	also	wore	loose	fitting	white	pants	and	golden

was	made	of	pure	gold.	He	also	wore	loose	fitting	white	pants	and	golden
sandals.	His	skin	was	bronzed	as	with	a	beautiful	deep	suntan.	Light	radiated
from	him	with	a	power	that	I	had	never	experienced.	Immediately	he	spoke,
saying:	“Women,	I	have	a	message	for	you	from	the	Father.”
Before	he	could	say	any	more	I	interrupted	him,	not	too	politely,	I’m	afraid.
“STOP!	Who	are	you?”
“I	am	your	guardian	angel.”
I	was	impressed,	not	only	by	his	size	and	shining	white	raiment,	but	also	by	a
look	of	such	purity	in	his	eyes.	However,	the	verse	in	II	Corinthians	11:14
flashed	into	my	mind:
“And	no	marvel	for	Satan	himself	is	transformed	into	an	angel	of	light.”
I	also	thought	about	the	scripture	verses	in	I	John	4:1-3:
“Beloved,	believe	not	every	spirit,	but	try	the	spirits	whether	they	are	of
God:	because	many	false	prophets	are	gone	out	into	the	world.	Hereby
know	ye	the	Spirit	of	God;	every	spirit	that	confesseth	that	Jesus	Christ	is
come	in	the	flesh	is	of	God;	and	every	spirit	that	confesseth	not	that	Jesus
Christ	is	come	in	the	flesh	is	not	of	God	...”
With	these	scriptures	going	through	my	mind	I	answered	curtly:
“Yes,	well,	I’ve	had	demons	try	to	tell	me	they	were	my	guardians.	WHO	is	your
master?	Whom	do	your	serve?”
“I	serve	the	Lord	of	Hosts.”
“That’s	not	good	enough,	Satan	calls	himself	that!”
He	smiled	again	and	said,	“I	serve	the	Lord	of	Lords	and	King	of	Kings.	Jesus
Christ	who	was	born	of	a	virgin,	came	to	earth	in	the	flesh,	died	on	the	cross	and
rose	from	the	grave	three	days	later.	This	same	Jesus	who	is	God	and	now	sits	in
heaven	on	the	right	hand	of	the	Father,	this	Jesus	is	my	Lord	and	master.”
I	was	relieved,	for	I	knew	that	he	had	passed	the	test	given	to	us	by	the	Lord	in	I
John	4.	I	knew	no	demon	would	dare	make	such	a	declaration,	Satan	would	tear
him	to	shreds	on	the	spot	if	he	did.
“Oh,	O.K.,	I’m	sorry,	but	I	had	to	be	sure	who	you	were.	I	was	afraid	you	were	a
demon	manifesting	in	such	a	form	to	try	to	deceive	me.”
He	nodded,	“Father	sent	me	to	tell	you	to	be	of	good	courage,	do	not	be	afraid	or

He	nodded,	“Father	sent	me	to	tell	you	to	be	of	good	courage,	do	not	be	afraid	or
discouraged	for	we	are	with	you	protecting	you	every	step	of	the	way.	The	battle
is	going	to	become	even	more	intense	from	this	point	on	and	Father	says	you
must	be	sure	to	always	put	on	the	armor	of	God.”
“Do	you	mean	the	armor	of	God	spoken	of	in	Ephesians	chapter	6?”
“Yes,	that	is	what	I	am	referring	to.”
Ephesians	6:10-18	says:
“Finally,	my	brethren,	be	strong	in	the	Lord,	and	in	the	power	of	his
might.	Put	on	the	whole	armor	of	God,	that	ye	may	be	able	to	stand
against	the	wiles	of	the	devil.	For	we	wrestle	not	against	flesh	and	blood,
but	against	principalities,	against	powers,	against	the	rulers	of	the
darkness	of	this	world,	against	spiritual	wickedness	in	high	places.
Wherefore	take	unto	you	the	whole	armor	of	God,	that	ye	may	be	able	to
withstand	in	the	evil	day,	and	having	done	all,	to	stand.	Stand	therefore,
having	your	loins	girt	about	with	truth,	and	having	on	the	breastplate	of
righteousness;	and	your	feet	shod	with	the	preparation	of	the	gospel	of
peace;	above	all,	taking	the	shield	of	faith,	wherewith	ye	shall	be	able	to
quench	all	the	fiery	darts	of	the	wicked.	And	take	the	helmet	of	salvation,
and	the	sword	of	the	Spirit,	which	is	the	word	of	God:	Praying	always
with	all	prayer	and	supplication	in	the	Spirit,	and	watching	thereunto
with	all	perseverance	and	supplication	for	all	saints.”
“But	tell	me,”	I	asked,	“how	do	I	put	this	armor	on?”
“Pray	like	this:	‘Father,	would	you	please	put	your	complete	armor	on	me	now,	I
ask	and	thank	you	for	it	in	the	name	of	Jesus.”’
“How	often	should	I	ask	for	the	armor?”
He	sat	looking	upward	for	a	few	seconds,	then	nodded	his	head	and	turned	back
to	me.
“Father	says	that	once	every	24	hours	will	be	sufficient.	Even	as	the	Lord	Jesus
told	you	when	He	was	here	on	earth	that	you	must	take	up	your	cross	daily,	so
must	you	put	on	the	armor	and	prepare	for	battle	daily.	You	must	understand	that
this	is	very	important.	Don’t	forget	to	ask	for	it	each	day.	If	you	don’t	have	the
armor	on	you	will	get	hurt.”
“But	I	don’t	understand,	I	can’t	see	this	armor,	and	the	scripture	sounds	as	if	it	is
rather	symbolic.	Where	does	it	go?”

“The	armor	of	God	goes	on	your	spirit	body.	God’s	word	plainly	states	that	you
are	engaged	in	a	spiritual	battle,	so	the	armor	is	also	spiritual.	You	need	to
search	your	scriptures	further	on	this.”
(The	following	day,	I	found	a	much	overlooked	verse	tucked	away	in	I
Corinthians	15:44	which	says	“There	is	a	natural	body,	and	there	is	a	spiritual
body.”)
Then	the	angel’s	sober	expression	lightened.	He	said,	“You	always	have	so
many	questions,	Father	says	you	are	permitted	to	ask	me	any	questions	you
have,	I	will	answer	them.”
Many	questions	were	buzzing	about	in	my	head.	But	there	was	one	thing	that	I
longed	to	know	most:	“Tell	me,	what	is	Jesus	really	like?	Please,	can	you	tell	me
more	about	Him?	I	so	long	to	know	Him	better.”
The	angel	sat	back,	crossing	his	legs	into	a	more	relaxed	position.	“Well,	Jesus	is
so	beautiful!	One	flash	of	His	smile	lights	up	the	whole	universe	with	warmth
and	love.	Jesus	works	so	intensely	and	tirelessly	for	His	church.	No	detail	of	the
care	of	each	one	of	His	people	is	too	small	for	His	undivided	attention.	He	is
constantly	at	work	both	caring	for	His	people	and	bringing	others	into	His
church.	His	glory	extends	out	and	out,	through	the	whole	universe	and	beyond.	It
never	ends.”
I	sat	pondering	his	words,	trying	to	picture	it	all	in	my	mind.	“I	have	often
wondered	if	Jesus’	glory	was	something	like	a	beautiful	sunrise.	I	mean,
everything	is	dark,	then	the	beautiful	light	and	colors	begin	to	creep	up	over	the
horizon.	The	light	and	colors	grow	and	grow	in	brightness	and	beauty	as	the	sun
gets	closer	and	closer	to	popping	up	over	the	horizon.	Then	as	it	does	so,	it	is	so
brilliant	and	beautiful.	Would	the	glory	of	Jesus	be	something	like	that	as	He
would	move	toward	you?”
“Yes,	that’s	it	exactly!”
We	sat	and	talked	for	close	to	two	hours.	I	will	never	forget	that	wonderful
experience.	The	love	of	God	radiated	from	this	creature	so	strongly	I	gained	a
fresh	understanding	of	just	how	much	God	loves	us.	The	angel	told	me	that	the
Lord	cares	so	much	for	His	children	that	every	time	one	of	them	cries	He	sends
an	angel	to	hold	that	person	in	his	arms	and	bring	comfort	to	him.	The	people
never	realize	this,	of	course,	but	it	happens	just	the	same.
The	angel	also	told	me	that	God	has	created	all	of	his	angels	with	so	much	love,
that	every	person	has	a	special	guardian	angel	who	guards	him	or	her	because	he

that	every	person	has	a	special	guardian	angel	who	guards	him	or	her	because	he
has	so	much	love	for	that	individual	that	he	petitioned	Father	for	the	job	of
guarding	him	from	his	birth.	I	was	reminded	of	Hebrews	1:13-14	which	says:
“But	to	which	of	the	angels	said	he	at	any	time,	Sit	on	my	right	hand,
until	I	make	thine	enemies	thy	footstool?	Are	they	not	all	ministering
spirits,	sent	forth	to	minister	for	them	who	shall	be	heirs	of	salvation?”
That	night	I	learned	in	a	new	depth	the	meaning	of	the	verse	which	says:
“But	as	it	is	written,	eye	hath	not	seen,	nor	ear	heard,	neither	have
entered	into	the	heart	of	man,	the	things	which	God	hath	prepared	for
them	that	love	him.	But	God	hath	revealed	them	unto	us	by	his	Spirit:	for
the	Spirit	searcheth	all	things,	yea,	the	deep	things	of	God.”	I	Corinthians
2:9
The	angel	had	pointed	out	many	scriptures	to	me	which,	as	I	prayerfully	studied
them,	revealed	much	more	of	the	incredible	plans	God	has	for	His	people	in	the
future.
The	battle	did	get	much	more	intense	after	that	meeting	with	the	angel,	but	I
found	that	each	day	as	I	asked	Father	for	the	armor,	I	had	more	strength	and	did
not	suffer	in	my	body	so	much	as	a	result	of	the	constant	conflict	with	the
demons.
During	this	time	of	battle	I	realized	that	I	had	reached	the	point	where	I	no
longer	cared	about	possessions	or	for	any	of	the	social	activities	I	used	to	enjoy.
I	was	growing	to	be	very	different	from	the	people	around	me.	I	could	not	share
my	experiences	with	anyone,	except,	occasionally	Pastor	Pat.	I	did	not	know	of
anyone	else	who	would	understand.	I	worried	that	I	was	not	staying	balanced.	I
took	the	problem	to	Father	in	prayer,	pouring	out	my	doubts	and	fears.	I	knew
that	I	would	never	be	smart	enough	to	detect	or	figure	out	Satan’s	deceptions,	I
had	to	trust	the	Lord	to	show	me	if	I	was	falling	into	a	trap	of	Satan’s.
At	that	point	the	Lord	instructed	me	to	read	the	first	epistle	of	Peter.	I	must
admit	that	I	was	rather	disappointed	as	I	didn’t	see	how	that	could	help,	but,	in
obedience,	I	did	what	Father	asked.	As	I	read,	the	Lord	opened	a	new
understanding	to	me	of	those	precious	verses:
“	...	to	the	strangers	scattered	throughout	...”	I	Peter	1:1	“Dearly	beloved,
I	beseech	you	as	strangers	and	pilgrims	....	”	I	Peter	1:11
Then	the	Lord	brought	two	other	scriptures	to	my	attention:
“Blessed	be	the	Lord	my	strength,	which	teacheth	my	hands	to	war,	and
my	fingers	to	fight:	My	goodness,	and	my	fortress;	my	high	tower,	and

my	fingers	to	fight:	My	goodness,	and	my	fortress;	my	high	tower,	and
my	deliverer;	my	shield,	and	he	in	whom	I	trust;	who	subdueth	my
people	under	me.”	Psalm	144:1-2	“For	our	light	affliction,	which	is	but
for	a	moment,	worketh	for	us	a	far	more	exceeding	and	eternal	weight	of
glory;	While	we	look	not	at	the	things	which	are	seen,	but	at	the	things
which	are	not	seen:	for	the	things	which	are	seen	are	temporal;	but	the
things	which	are	not	seen	are	eternal.”	II	Corinthians	4:17-18
There	is	a	price	to	be	paid	when	we	fix	our	eyes	(or	attention)	on	what	is
“unseen.”	We	become	aliens	and	strangers	in	this	world.	We	do	not	really	have	a
home	here	on	earth.	We	will	arrive	home	at	last	only	when	Jesus	returns	to	take
us	home	to	live	with	Himself.
As	the	weeks	went	by	I	became	increasingly	concerned	that	the	intense	battle
with	the	demons	was	destroying	Elaine’s	body.	I	had	many	times	asked	Father
how	long	this	must	go	on	and	always	His	answer	was,	“Until	you	have	learned
enough.”	At	last	the	day	came	when	Father	told	me	to	contact	Pastor	Pat	to
arrange	a	time	for	Elaine’s	final	deliverance.	I	did	so,	but	did	not	tell	Elaine.	I
knew	that	if	I	did,	then	the	demons	in	her	would	hear	and	do	all	they	could	to
hinder	us.
As	the	day	of	Elaine’s	final	deliverance	approached	both	the	demons	and	the
spirits	of	the	local	witches	and	warlocks	were	becoming	a	greater	and	greater
problem.	We	could	not	see	them,	so	had	no	forewarning	of	their	attacks.	Elaine
and	I	were	constantly	being	picked	up	and	thrown	across	the	room,	furniture	and
other	objects	were	frequently	being	thrown	at	us	—	all	by	unseen	beings.	We
were	both	bruised	from	head	to	toe	because	of	their	attacks.
At	last	the	night	before	Elaine’s	final	deliverance	came.	We	were	both
completely	exhausted	and	I	was	very	worried	as	Elaine	was	also	quite	ill.	We
tried	to	lie	down	but	continuously	one	or	the	other	of	us	was	pulled	off	our	bed
by	an	unseen	spirit	and	thrown	onto	the	floor	or	against	the	wall.	There	was	a
growing	presence	of	evil	in	the	house	which	weighed	heavily	on	my	spirit.	Even
the	air	seemed	so	thick	with	evil	that	it	was	difficult	to	breath.
Late	that	night	I	was	sitting	on	the	edge	of	Elaine’s	bed	cradling	her	in	my	arms,
desperately	trying	to	hold	her	and	shield	her	with	my	own	body	from	the
continuous	attacks.	She	was	so	weak	by	then	that	she	had	no	strength	left	to	even
try	to	resist	the	attacks.	Tears	streamed	down	my	face	as	I	cried	out	to	the	Lord
for	help.
“FLEE!	”	One	word	was	suddenly	flashed	into	my	spirit	and	mind	with	great

force.	“FLEE!	”	Then	the	Lord	flooded	into	my	mind	the	scripture	in	Matthew
chapter	2	where	Joseph	was	instructed	by	an	angel	of	the	Lord	in	the	middle	of
the	night	to	take	Mary	and	the	infant	Jesus	and	flee	into	Egypt.	I	knew	then	that	I
must	take	Elaine	and	run,	or	we	would	both	be	killed.
I	asked	the	Lord	to	surround	us	so	that	the	demons	and	human	spirits	could	not
see	us	leaving.	Immediately	my	spiritual	eyes	were	opened	and	I	saw	a	ring	of
powerful	warrior	angels	close	about	us.	Elaine	was	barely	conscious	and
completely	unable	to	walk.	I	was	not	much	stronger	than	she,	but	knew	that	we
must	be	obedient	to	that	urgent	command.	So,	I	stumbled	off	the	bed	with	Elaine
in	my	arms.	As	I	began	to	fall	under	her	weight	I	heard	one	of	the	angels	snap	a
command	and	immediately	two	angels	lifted	us.	They	essentially	carried	us	out
to	the	car.	They	put	Elaine	in	the	passenger’s	seat	and	securely	seat-belted	her	in,
then	carefully	closed	and	locked	the	door.	She	was	completely	unconscious	by
then.
I	was	not	sure	where	to	go,	so	just	started	out.	It	was	a	beautiful	clear	night,	the
stars	and	moon	were	shining	brightly.	As	I	drove	down	the	highway,	the	Lord
permitted	me	to	see	through	my	spirit	what	was	going	on	back	at	my	house.	The
demons	and	human	spirits	were	frantically	going	all	through	the	house	and	yard
searching	for	us.	I	praised	the	Lord	for	His	goodness	and	mercy	to	us.	Satan	and
his	servants	had	no	idea	where	we	were.	We	were	completely	hidden!	Then	the
Lord	instructed	me	to	go	to	my	brother’s	house.	We	arrived	about	3	A.M.	and
spent	the	rest	of	the	night	there.
The	next	morning,	I	again	put	Elaine	in	the	car	and	headed	for	the	church.	About
a	half-mile	from	the	church	Elaine	turned	to	me	and	said:	“Rebecca,	you	have
not	told	me	where	we	are	going.	Now	please	be	honest	and	tell	me	what	in	the
world	is	going	on?”	“Well,	we	are	headed	for	the	church.	Today	is	the	day	the
Lord	has	chosen	for	your	final	deliverance.”
“Great!”	That	was	the	only	word	Elaine	managed	to	get	out.	Immediately	the
demons	surfaced.	They	were	raging,	screaming	mad.	I	was	thankful	that	I	had
obeyed	the	Lord	and	had	carefully	seat-belted	Elaine	in	and	locked	the	door.
Otherwise	the	demons	would	have	thrown	her	out	of	the	car.	As	we	rounded	the
corner	into	the	church	drive	their	struggle	to	escape	became	frantic.	But	the	Lord
had	everything	well	planned.	As	I	pulled	to	a	stop	and	turned	to	try	to	hang	on	to
Elaine,	my	friend	Judy,	who	was	there	to	help	us,	walked	quickly	to	my	car,	an
open	Bible	in	hand.	She	pulled	open	Elaine’s	door	and	said:	“Just	listen	to	the
scripture	the	Lord	has	given	us	for	today:
‘I	will	praise	thee	with	my	whole	heart:	before	the	gods	will	sing	praise

‘I	will	praise	thee	with	my	whole	heart:	before	the	gods	will	sing	praise
unto	thee.
I	will	worship	toward	thy	holy	temple,	and	praise	thy	name	for	thy
lovingkindness	and	for	thy	truth:	for	thou	hast	magnified	thy	word	above
all	thy	name.
‘In	the	day	when	I	cried	thou	answered	me,	and	strengthenedst	me	with
strength	in	my	soul.
All	the	kings	of	the	earth	shall	praise	thee,	O	Lord,	when	they	hear	the
words	of	thy	mouth.
Yea,	they	shall	sing	in	the	ways	of	the	Lord:	for	great	is	the	glory	of	the
Lord.
‘Though	the	Lord	be	high,	yet	hath	he	respect	unto	the	lowly:
but	the	proud	he	knoweth	afar	off.	Though	I	walk	in	the	midst	of	trouble,
thou	wilt	revive	me:	thou	shalt	stretch	forth	thine	hand	against	the	wrath
of	mine	enemies,	and	thy	right	hand	shall	save	me.
‘The	Lord	will	perfect	that	which	concerneth	me:	thy	mercy,	O	Lord,
endureth	for	ever:	Forsake	not	the	works	of	thine	own	hands.“’
Psalm	138
As	Judy	read	those	beautiful	words	the	demons	in	Elaine	quieted	down	and	came
under	control.	Then	Judy	and	I	helped	Elaine	out	of	the	car.	As	we	came	to	the
church	door	they	began	to	struggle	frantically	again.	But	again,	the	Lord	had
everything	in	hand.	Pastor	Pat	and	the	assistant	pastor	met	us	at	the	church	door.
The	men	each	grabbed	one	of	Elaine’s	arms.
“I	see	we	have	some	very	unhappy	demons	here,”	Pastor	Pat	exclaimed.	“Now
you	demons	shut-up	and	be	still.	We	bind	you	in	the	name	of	Jesus!”	If	the	Lord
had	not	had	the	men	at	the	door	to	help	us,	I	doubt	that	Judy	and	I	would	have
been	strong	enough	to	get	Elaine	down	the	hall	to	the	Pastor’s	study.
Immediately,	when	the	five	of	us	entered	the	study	and	the	door	was	closed,	the
battle	was	on.	It	raged	for	the	next	ten	hours.	The	demons	were	like	caged	wild
animals	and	they	fought	desperately	for	they	knew	their	final	hour	had	come.
But	they	didn’t	stand	a	chance	for	the	power	and	the	presence	of	the	Lord	was	in
that	room	in	a	remarkable	way.
That	day	will	always	remain	in	my	mind	as	one	of	the	most	beautiful
experiences	I	have	ever	had.	The	Lord	was	in	complete	control	and	there	was
absolutely	smooth	coordination	as	He	used	first	one	of	us,	then	another.	We	had

absolutely	smooth	coordination	as	He	used	first	one	of	us,	then	another.	We	had
not	been	able	to	completely	deliver	Elaine	before	because	we	did	not	know	all
the	doorways	to	close.	That	day	the	Lord	gave	us	revelation	after	revelation.
With	a	person	deeply	possessed	as	Elaine	was,	the	demons	must	be	cleaned	out
from	the	inside	out.	I	have	listed	below	the	doorways	in	the	order	in	which	they
must	be	closed.	The	Lord	showed	us	that	day,	and	in	many	many	instances	since
then	that	it	is	much	easier	and	more	efficient	to	clean	out	a	person	by	areas	rather
than	going	after	specific	demons.	Also,	in	this	way	the	deliverance	workers
control	the	demons	instead	of	waiting	to	see	what	will	manifest.	The	leader	or
head	over	each	area	is	cast	out	along	with	all	his	subordinate	demons	at	the	same
time.	There	are	just	too	many	demons	to	try	to	cast	out	each	one	individually	—
it	would	take	far	too	much	time,	causing	everyone	involved	to	become	too
exhausted	and	discouraged.	(For	instance	the	demon	Legion	may	have	up	to
4,000	subordinate	demons	with	him.	Our	Lord	Jesus	set	us	the	example	of
casting	them	all	out	at	once	in	Luke	chapter	8.)
1.	In	most	persons	involved	deeply	in	the	occult	there	is	a	doorway	for
Satan	himself.	This	innermost	doorway	is	held	open	by	a	very	high
demon	who	refers	to	himself	as	a	“son	of	Satan.”	(Note:	this	title	will
change	with	different	geographical	areas,	and	the	specific	names	of	these
demons	also	change,	and	are	too	numerous	to	try	to	list.	Specifying	the
demon	by	his	function	will	be	sufficient	to	establish	authority	over	him.)
This	doorway	permits	Satan	himself	to	enter	a	person	and	speak	and	act
through	their	body	at	will.
2.	The	next	is	the	area	of	the	human	spirit.	There	is	one	high	demon	over
the	entire	spirit.	This	demon	is	frequently	called	a	“guiding	spirit”	but
may	take	different	titles	in	various	areas.	Mann-Chan	was	Elaine’s
guiding	spirit.	Then	there	are	three	areas	within	the	spirit	itself,	each	area
has	a	head	demon	with	many	lesser	demons	under	his	command.	The
three	areas	in	the	spirit	are:
conscience	—	the	ability	to	discern	right	and	wrong
intuition	—	the	ability	to	discern	the	Lord	and	sense	His	presence
worship	—	the	area	through	which	we	worship	the	Lord	“in
spirit”	as	in	John	4:23:	“But	the	hour	cometh,	and	now	is,	when
the	true	worshipers	shall	worship	the	Father	in	spirit	and	in	truth	.
.	.	”
3.	The	soul	has	several	areas.	The	head	demon	over	the	entire	area	of	the

soul	usually	refers	to	himself	as	a	“power”	demon.	These	power	demons
will	be	discussed	at	some	length	in	chapter	14	where	we	deal	with	the
topic	of	the	soul-controlled	spirit.	There	are	6	areas	within	the	soul.	The
first	3	have	to	do	with	controlling	the	spirit:
conscious	
sub-conscious	
unconscious
Then	there	are	3	other	areas:
will	
mind	
emotions
Again,	each	has	a	head	demon	with	underlings.
4.	Last	is	the	physical	body.	The	head	demon	over	the	body	is	usually	a
“death	demon”	such	as	Yaagog.	They	are	powerful	and	quite	capable	of
bringing	about	the	physical	death	of	the	person	they	inhabit	through
illness	within	a	very	short	time	if	not	restrained	by	the	Lord.	The	areas
within	the	body	are:
brain	—	meaning	the	physical	organ	the	rest	of	the	physical	body
itself
sexual	—	the	head	demon	in	that	area	holds	open	the	door	which
gives	Satan	the	legal	right	to	have	sexual	relations	with	the
person,	also	other	demons	as	well.
There	are	many	scriptures	that	refer	to	and	confirm	the	above	areas.	Time	and
space	does	not	permit	the	listing	of	them	all.	The	one	that	was	the	most
important	to	us	was:
“And	the	very	God	of	peace	sanctify	you
wholly;	and	I	pray	God	your	whole	spirit	and
soul	and	body	be	preserved	blameless	unto	the
coming	of	our	Lord	Jesus	Christ.”
I	Thessalonians	5:23
If	you	have	further	questions	about	these	areas	I	would	strongly	recommend	that

you	read	the	book	The	Spiritual	Man	by	Watchman	Nee	which	gives	excellent
scriptural	references	and	an	explanation	of	these	areas.
The	assistant	pastor	had	never	experienced	a	deliverance	session	before	and	had
not	known	about	this	one	until	an	hour	or	so	before	it	started.	I	was	most	amused
when,	about	half	way	through,	as	we	stopped	for	a	short	break,	he	made	the
comment:
“You	know,	all	this	makes	mowing	the	grass	seem	awfully	mundane	somehow!”
Then	he	went	on	to	tell	us	about	a	remarkable	experience	he	had	had	the	evening
before.	It	was	fairly	late	and	he	was	sitting	in	his	study	at	the	church	reading
when:
“Suddenly	the	Holy	Spirit	pulled	the	book	out	of	my	hands	and	threw	my	hands
up	in	the	air	and	commanded	me	to	stand	up.	As	I	did	so,	He	told	me	to	get	a
bottle	of	oil	and	go	to	the	Pastor’s	study.	I	was	the	only	person	in	the	church	at
the	time.	The	Holy	Spirit	then	instructed	me	to	close	and	lock	the	doors	and
anoint	the	door	posts	and	lintels,	then	the	doors	themselves,	then	all	the
windows,	in	the	name	of	the	Father,	Son	and	Holy	Spirit,	and	to	ask	the	Lord	to
seal	this	room.	I	did	so	but	had	no	idea	why.	This	room	remained	closed	and
sealed	until	we	entered	it	this	morning.”
We	all	praised	the	Lord	for	His	provision.	The	sealing	of	that	room	was	to
provide	protection	from	any	outside	interference	during	Elaine’s	deliverance.
In	all,	the	battle	lasted	over	ten	hours.	What	a	time	of	praise	and	rejoicing	we
had	at	the	end!	Once	again,	the	Lord	had	remained	faithful	to	His	word,	and	had
SET	THE	CAPTIVE	FREE.	From	that	day	on	Elaine	has	remained	clear	and
free	from	demons.	We	cannot	praise	and	thank	the	Lord	enough	for	her
wonderful	deliverance!

CHAPTER	13
Doorways

REBECCA	TALKS:
The	scriptures	are	very	plain.	Any	dealing	with	Satan	opens	a	doorway	in	a
person’s	life	for	the	inflow	of	Satanic	power	and/or	demon	infestation.	Whether
the	person	is	a	Christian	or	a	non-Christian	makes	no	difference.	Leviticus	19:31
states,	“Regard	not	them	that	have	familiar	spirits,	neither	seek	after	wizards,	to
be	defiled	by	them:	I	am	the	Lord	your	God.”
Although	The	Brotherhood	is	a	very	strong	and	fast	growing	cult,	they	are	but	a
handful	compared	to	the	vast	numbers	held	in	bondage	by	peripheral
involvement	in	the	occult	and	other	sins	which	have	opened	up	their	lives	to
Satan’s	power.	These	doorways	(created	by	sin)	give	Satan	legal	ground,
according	to	God’s	word	(the	Bible),	to	exert	his	power	in	their	lives.	Christians
are	not	protected	because	the	opening	of	these	doorways	involves	their
conscious	participation	in	sin	and/or	ignorance.
“What	then?	shall	we	sin	because	we	are	not
under	the	law,	but	under	grace?	God	forbid.
Know	ye	not,	that	to	whom	ye	yield	yourselves
servants	to	obey,	his	servants	ye	are	to	whom	ye
obey;	whether	of	sin	unto	death,	or	of	obedience
unto	righteousness?”
Romans	6:15-16	6
“My	people	are	destroyed	for	lack	of	knowledge
...	”
Hosea	4:6
Not	only	does	every	person	need	to	be	aware	of	these	areas	of	influence	in	his
own	life,	but	also	anyone	who	desires	to	share	the	glorious	gospel	of	Jesus	Christ
with	others.	Many,	many	are	not	able	to	accept	Christ	when	He	is	presented	to
them	because	their	will	and	mind	is	literally	bound	by	the	dark	powers	through
some	opened	doorway	in	their	lives	either	currently	or	in	the	past.
“But	if	our	gospel	be	hid,	it	is	hid	to	them	that

“But	if	our	gospel	be	hid,	it	is	hid	to	them	that
are	lost:	In	whom	the	god	of	this	world	hath
blinded	the	minds	of	them	which	believe	not,
lest	the	light	of	the	glorious	gospel	of	Christ,
who	is	the	image	of	God,	should	shine	unto
them.”
II	Corinthians	4:3-4
Any	dealings	with	the	occult,	no	matter	how	lightly	or	briefly,	is	a	doorway.	I
am	referring	to	such	things	as	playing	with	your	horoscope,	the	curiosity	visit	to
a	fortune	teller,	tea	leaf	reader,	palm	reader,	etc.	How	many	of	our	school	and
church	carnivals	for	fund	raising	have	a	fortune	teller	of	some	sort?	None	of
these	are	harmless!	Innocent	young	children	are	allowed	to	go	to	these	people	at
such	events	for	“something	fun	to	do.”	How	many	of	these	children	are	then
unable	in	their	future	life	to	ever	accept	Jesus	as	their	personal	Savior,	or,	if	they
are	already	a	Christian,	at	some	later	date	lose	interest,	or	are	just	unable	to	grow
to	any	depth	in	their	Christianity?	We	would	be	appalled	if	we	really	knew	the
number	of	casualties	from	this	source	alone.	I	have	personally	seen	more	than	I
like	to	even	think	about.	Again,	the	scriptures	could	not	be	more	plain:
“There	shall	not	be	found	among	you	any	one
that	maketh	his	son	or	his	daughter	to	pass
through	the	fire	[a	form	of	human	sacrifice	to	a
demon],	or	that	useth	divination,	or	an	observer
of	times,	or	an	enchanter,	or	a	witch,	or	a
charmer,	or	a	consulter	with	familiar	spirits,	or	a
wizard,	or	a	necromancer.	For	all	that	do	these
things	are	an	abomination	unto	the	Lord:	and
because	of	these	abominations	the	Lord	thy	God
doth	drive	them	out	from	before	thee.”
Deuteronomy	18:10-12.
Just	one	visit	to	a	seance	out	of	curiosity	is	enough	to	affect	the	rest	of	your	life.
So	is	studying	books	on	the	occult	arts,	playing	with	an	ouiji	board,	trying	out
ESP,	psychic	experiences,	astral	projection,	meditation	of	any	kind	that	involves
blanking	out	or	“clearing”	the	mind,	water	witching,	or	divining	for	oil	or
minerals	by	using	a	dowsing	rod	or	pendulum.	Equally	dangerous	is

participation	in	magic	of	any	kind,	using	the	art	of	levitation,	i.e.	movement	of
objects	without	touching	that	object	physically,	consulting	a	medium	or	spiritist
in	an	attempt	to	locate	some	missing	object,	practice	of	any	of	the	martial	arts	or
yoga.	And,	of	course,	any	practice	of	witchcraft	through	spells	or	incantations,
etc.	Any	of	this	will	open	a	doorway	to	the	inflow	of	Satanic	power	and	demons.
Any	use	of,	or	abuse	of	street	drugs,	or	repeated	drunkenness	are	also	doorways.
Child	abuse	almost	always	results	in	demonic	infestation.	That	is	why	abused
children,	unless	delivered,	usually	turn	out	to	be	child-abusing	parents.	Any
incident	of	severe	emotional	and/or	physical	trauma	may	serve	as	a	temporary
breakdown	in	the	defenses	permitting	the	entrance	of	demonic	spirits.	This	may
occur	in	both	children	and	adults.
Sexual	intercourse	is	another	big	doorway.	Demons	are	passed	from	one	person
to	another	through	sexual	intercourse.	This	is	because	the	two	people	involved
become	“one	flesh.”
“What?	know	ye	not	that	he	which	is	joined	to
an	harlot	is	one	body?	for	two,	saith	he,	shall	be
one	flesh	...	Flee	fornication.	Every	sin	that	a
man	doeth	is	without	the	body;	but	he	that
commiteth	fornication	sinneth	against	his	own
body.”
I	Corinthians	6:16	&	18
The	word	fornication	means	any	sexual	intercourse	between	a	man	and	woman
who	are	not	married	to	each	other.	(Definition	from	Vine’s	Expository

This	is	why	God	has	given	His	people	so	many	commands	not	to	have	sexual
intercourse	between	anyone	who	is	not	man	and	wife.	It	is	for	our	protection
from	this	source	of	demonic	infestation.	Rape	and	violent	sexual	assault,
particularly	in	children,	is	a	doorway	that	I	have	come	across	repeatedly	in	my
medical	practice.	This	results	in	the	demonic	entrance	of	some	of	the	strongest
demons	that	I	have	ever	met.	Incest	within	a	family	and	any	participation	in
homosexuality	always	leads	to	demonic	infestation.	Also	any	of	the	corrupt
sexual	practices	condemned	in	the	Bible	and	used	in	the	pornography	of	today.
I	have	frequently	been	asked	about	problems	arising	from	sexual	intercourse
between	a	man	and	wife	when	one	of	the	spouses	is	unsaved	and	participating	in

between	a	man	and	wife	when	one	of	the	spouses	is	unsaved	and	participating	in
blatant	sin.	In	these	cases,	I	firmly	believe	that	the	believing	spouse	can	stand	on
the	promise	given	in	I	Corinthians	7:12-16:
“If	any	brother	hath	a	wife	that	believeth	not,	and	she	be	pleased	to	dwell
with	him,	let	him	not	put	her	away.	And	the	woman	which	hath	an
husband	that	believeth	not,	and	if	he	be	pleased	to	dwell	with	her,	let	her
not	leave	him.	For	the	unbelieving	husband	is	sanctified	by	the	wife,	and
the	unbelieving	wife	is	sanctified	by	the	husband:	else	were	your	children
unclean;	but	now	are	they	holy.	But	if	the	unbelieving	depart,	let	him
depart.	A	brother	or	a	sister	is	not	under	bondage	in	such	cases:	but	God
hath	called	us	to	peace.	For	what	knowest	thou,	O	wife,	whether	thou
shalt	save	thy	husband?	or	how	knowest	thou,	O	man,	whether	thou	shalt
save	thy	wife?”
In	such	cases,	the	Christian	spouse	need	only	ask	the	Lord	to	sanctify	their
marriage	bed	and	their	unbelieving	spouse	and	close	that	doorway	with	the	blood
of	Jesus	so	that	the	believing	spouse	will	not	become	infested	with	demons	from
the	other	through	their	sexual	intercourse.
Hypnosis	is	another	big	doorway.	The	person	being	hypnotized	must	so	subject
his	or	her	will	to	the	hypnotist	that	he	then	becomes	open	to	anything	the
hypnotist	chooses	to	put	into	him.	There	are	specific	demons	that	hold	open	the
doors	for	the	on-going	influence	of	the	hypnotist.	Hypnosis	to	stop	smoking	or
control	eating	to	lose	weight	is	a	demonic	healing.
Acupuncture	also	is	a	form	of	demonic	healing.	The	Eastern	religions	are	all
various	forms	of	demon	worship.	The	public	does	not	know	that	the	needles	used
in	acupuncture	are	blessed	by	various	leaders	of	the	Eastern	religions	before	use
and	therefore	are	direct	doorways	for	demonic	entrance.	I	have	seen	a	number	of
really	strange	infections	coming	from	the	needles	of	acupuncturists	as	well	as
demonic	infestation.	Any	supernatural	healing	other	than	that	which	comes
directly	from	Jesus	Christ	himself,	is	demonic	healing	and	results	in	demonic
infestation	and/or	bondage.	God	himself	gave	men	the	gift	of	the	knowledge
used	by	our	medical	doctors	today.	Remember	that	Luke,	who	wrote	two	books
of	the	New	Testament,	was	himself	a	physician.
Any	involvement	in	the	Eastern	religions	such	as	T.M.	(Transcendental
Meditation),	Yoga,	etc.,	will	result	in	demonic	infestation	and/or	bondage.
Careful	study	comparing	the	teachings	of	any	cult	with	God’s	word	will	quickly
show	their	errors.
Most	of	the	Eastern	religions	involve	meditation.	The	topic	of	meditation	is

Most	of	the	Eastern	religions	involve	meditation.	The	topic	of	meditation	is
much	misunderstood	by	most	Christians	and	Satan	has	authored	much	deceptive
literature	on	meditation	posing	as	Christian	literature.	There	are	a	number	of
references	in	scripture	to	meditation,	but	there	is	a	big	difference	between	Godly
meditation	and	Satanic	meditation.	I	think	it	would	be	well	to	point	out	the	basic
principles	here.
One	of	the	major	scripture	references	to	meditation	is	found	in	Joshua	1:8:
“This	book	of	the	law	shall	not	depart	out	of	thy	mouth;	but	thou	shalt
meditate	therein	day	and	night,	that	thou	mayest	observe	to	do	according
to	all	that	is	written	therein:	for	then	thou	shalt	make	thy	way	prosperous,
and	then	thou	shalt	have	good	success.”
I	wish	to	emphasize	that	the	meditation	referred	to	in	this	scripture	involved	the
active	reading,	learning	and	memorizing	of	God’s	law	given	to	the	Israelites.
Joshua	was	to	learn	the	law	so	well	that	it	would	become	a	part	of	him.	David
followed	the	same	principle	—	he	wrote	about	it	in	Psalm	119:9-11:
“Wherewithal	shall	a	young	man	cleanse	his	way?	By	taking	heed	thereto
according	to	thy	word.	With	my	whole	heart	have	I	sought	thee:	O	let	me
not	wander	from	thy	commandments.	Thy	word	have	I	hid	in	mine	heart,
that	I	might	not	sin	against	thee.”
Here	again	David	was	actively	doing	something	—	that	is,	learning	and
memorizing	God’s	law	so	that	he	would	not	depart	from	it.	At	no	time	in
scripture	is	meditation	something	passive.	Satanic	meditation	is	passive.	Satan
wants	men	to	blank	out	their	minds,	attempt	to	clear	their	minds	of	all	thoughts.
This	directly	opens	a	door	for	demonic	entrance	and	influence,	because	the
simple	fact	is	that	God	commands	us	to	control	our	every	thought,	not	blank
out	our	minds!	If	you	don’t	control	your	mind,	Satan	will.
“For	though	we	walk	in	the	flesh,	we	do	not	war	after	the	flesh:	For	the
weapons	of	our	warfare	are	not	carnal,	but	mighty	through	God	to	the
pulling	down	of	strong	holds;	casting	down	imaginations,	and	every
high	thing	[thoughts,	in	other	translations]	that	exalteth	itself	against	the
knowledge	of	God,	and	bringing	into	captivity	every	thought	to	the
obedience	of	Christ.”	II	Corinthians	10:3-5
“Thou	wilt	keep	him	in	perfect	peace,	whose	mind	is	stayed	on	thee	...”
Isaiah	26:3
This	scripture	clearly	demonstrates	that	we	are	commanded	to	control	our

minds,	not	blank	them	out.	Any	teaching	about	meditation	that	tells	you	to	blank
out	your	mind	and	clear	it	of	all	thoughts,	or	to	repeat	certain	phrases	over	and
over	again	to	enable	you	to	“clear	your	mind”	is	from	Satan.
“[Jesus	speaking]	But	when	ye	pray,	use	not	vain	repetitions,	as	the
heathen	do	...”	“	Matthew	6:7	”But	shun	profane	and	vain	babblings:	for
they	will	increase	unto	more	ungodliness.”	II	Timothy	2:16
There	is	a	dangerous	teaching	in	some	charismatic	churches	where	members	are
told	to	repeat	a	certain	phrase	over	and	over,	or	to	“blank	out	their	minds	and	let
the	Holy	Spirit	take	over.”	(This	is	especially	done	in	reference	to	an	effort	to	get
someone	to	speak	in	tongues.)	Any	blank	mind	will	be	taken	over	by	a	spirit
alright,	but	unfortunately,	an	unholy	spirit	not	the	Holy	Spirit.
Another	form	of	occult	bondage	that	is	very	real,	but	little	recognized,	is	the
placing	of	a	“hex”	or	“spell”	or	“voodoo”	upon	a	person	by	another	person.	Even
a	Christian	can	be	terribly	damaged	by	witchcraft	of	this	sort	directed	toward
them.	My	own	experience	is	a	good	example	of	this.	I	was	unaware	of	what	was
happening	until	the	Lord	gave	my	pastor	the	revelation.	I	have	since	come	across
many	patients	afflicted	in	this	way.	Often,	they	knew	a	person,	or	had	a	person
involved	in	the	occult	as	a	friend;	then	had	a	quarrel	with	that	person,	never
suspecting	that	as	an	act	of	vengeance	a	“hex”	or	“spell”	was	sent	their	way.	For
this	reason	it	is	imperative	that	Christians	walk	closely	enough	with	the	Lord
that	He	can	give	them	discernment	in	such	cases.
Demons	and	demonic	bondage	are	inherited.	The	doorway	of	inheritance	is	an
often	overlooked	one.	Although	we	are	no	longer	under	the	old	law	because	of
the	new	covenant	in	Christ’s	blood,	we	can	find	some	very	important	principles
by	studying	the	Old	Testament.	We	must	also	bear	in	mind	that	any	sin	not
brought	under	Christ’s	blood	by	us	is	legal	ground	for	Satan.
There	are	many	references	in	the	Old	Testament	to	the	sins	of	the	fathers	being
passed	down	to	the	sons.	Some	are	found	in	Exodus	20:5,	34:7,	Numbers	14:18
and	Deuteronomy	5:9.	Exodus	34:6-7	says:
“And	the	Lord	passed	by	before	him,	and	proclaimed,	The	Lord,	The
Lord	God,	merciful	and	gracious,	longsuffering,	and	abundant	in
goodness	and	truth,	keeping	mercy	for	thousands,	forgiving	iniquity	and
transgression	and	sin,	and	that	will	by	no	means	clear	the	guilty;	visiting
the	iniquity	of	the	fathers	upon	the	children,	and	upon	the	children’s
children,	unto	the	third	and	to	the	fourth	generation.”
We	also	find	that	every	time	there	was	a	major	revival	in	Israel,	the	people	came

We	also	find	that	every	time	there	was	a	major	revival	in	Israel,	the	people	came
together	in	fasting	and	prayer	not	only	to	confess	their	own	sins,	but	the	sins	of
their	fathers	also.	For	example,	Nehemiah	9:1-2:
“Now	in	the	twenty	and	fourth	day	of	this	month	the	children	of	Israel
were	assembled	with	fasting,	and	with	sackclothes,	and	earth	upon	them.
And	the	seed	of	Israel	separated	themselves	from	all	strangers,	and	stood
and	confessed	their	sins,	and	the	iniquities	[sins	or	evil	deeds]	of	their
fathers.”
Other	references	are	II	Chronicles	29:1-11	during	the	reign	of	King	Hezekiah,	II
Chronicles	34:	19-21,	and	many	other	references	as	well.
The	sins	of	our	ancestors	do	have	a	grave	effect	on	our	own	lives	and	the
doorway	of	inheritance	must	be	closed	by	prayer,	confession,	and	the	cleansing
power	of	the	blood	of	Jesus	Christ.	Specific	abilities	and	demons	are	passed
down	from	generation	to	generation.	A	commonly	accepted	example	of	this	is
the	ability	to	“water-witch.”	Especially	damaging	is	any	involvement	in	the
occult,	any	idol	worship	which	is	really	demon	worship	(I	Corinthians	10:1421),	any	demonic	infestation,	any	oaths	taken	by	parents	or	ancestors	which	are
binding	upon	descendants	(as	are	most	occult,	pagan,	Morman,	Masonic	oaths)
etc.
One	of	Satan’s	biggest	tools	in	our	country	today	is	the	occultic	role-playing
fantasy	games	which	have	become	so	popular.	Satan	is	using	these	games	to
produce	a	vast	army	of	the	most	intelligent	young	people	of	this	country;	an
army	that	the	Anti-Christ	will	be	able	to	tap	into	and	control	in	an	instant.
Through	their	involvement	in	these	games,	people	can	be	controlled	demonically
without	them	ever	realizing	what	is	happening.	In	many	states	such	games	are
used	as	a	part	of	the	school	curriculum	for	the	more	intelligent	students.	Almost
every	school	has	extracurricular	clubs	formed	to	play	the	games.	In	essence,
such	games	are	crash	courses	in	witchcraft.	Unfortunately	the	participants
usually	do	not	realize	this	until	it	is	too	late.
Most	games	have	a	leader	who	plans	the	over-all	outline	for	each	game.	The
game	is	an	adventure	in	which	many	battles	are	fought	with	various	“monsters”
and	“beings,”	each	one	having	certain	abilities	and	characteristics.	There	are
numerous	thick	manuals	available	with	pictures	and	many	details	about	the
abilities	of	the	various	characters.	The	players	are	supposed	to	“visualize”	the
action	of	the	game	in	their	minds.	The	better	they	become	at	“seeing”	the	action
and	therefore	anticipating	the	moves	of	the	various	“monsters”	and	the	other
players,	the	more	advanced	they	become	in	the	game.

What	people	don’t	realize	at	first	is	that	these	monsters	are	actually	real	demons.
What	they	think	they	are	visualizing	in	their	minds,	they	are	in	actuality
beginning	to	see	in	the	spirit	world.	The	better	they	become	at	“seeing”	the
game,	the	more	in-tune	they	are	with	the	spirit	world.	The	imagination	is	a	key
stepping	stone	to	contact	with	the	spirit	world.	I	do	not	know	at	what	point	the
players	become	infested	with	demons,	but	I	have	worked	with	many	young
people	involved	in	the	games	and	I	have	yet	to	meet	anyone	on	the	level	of	a
game	leader	who	was	not	indwelt	by	demons	and	knew	it.	They	will,	of	course,
lie	about	this.	A	number	have	told	me	that	the	demons	would	come	and	talk	to
them,	and,	to	gain	more	power,	they	invite	the	more	intelligent	of	the	demons	to
come	into	them.
The	more	advanced	manuals	detail	spells,	incantations,	and	satanic	writing	that
is	used	and	taught	to	the	witches	and	warlocks	of	The	Brotherhood	itself.	All
who	play	the	games	feel	the	strange	fascination	and	power	of	them.	Few	realize
what	a	trap	it	is,	they	are	completely	deceived.	How	many	of	our	young	people
who	were	once	active	and	enthusiastic	Christians	have	lost	interest	in	the	Lord	as
a	result	of	playing	this	type	of	game?	Untold	numbers	more	will	never	come	to	a
saving	knowledge	of	Jesus	because	of	the	demonic	bondage	they	have	come
under	by	playing	these	games.
Occultic	influences	are	rampant	in	toys	for	small	children	as	well	as	the	cartoons
on	TV.	Small	children	are	naturally	very	imaginative.	Satan	knows	that	if	he	can
direct	their	imagination	to	the	spirit	world	they	will	quickly	learn	to	see	and
communicate	with	his	demons.	Parents	need	to	be	extremely	careful	what	toys
they	permit	their	little	ones	to	play	with,	and	what	cartoons	they	permit	them	to
watch	on	TV.
Biofeedback	has	literally	exploded	onto	the	medical	scene	within	the	last	few
years.	Its	growth	has	been	phenomenal.	It	is	used	mainly	for	pain	control,	blood
pressure	control	and	to	control	drug	and	alcohol	abuse.	The	Brotherhood	used
biofeedback	for	many,	many	years	before	it	ever	came	into	public	use.	They
found	that	it	was	the	most	rapid	method	of	training	witches	to	gain	conscious
control	of	their	spirit	bodies	and	thereby	to	contact	the	spirit	world.	In	essence,
biofeedback	trains	a	person	to	control	those	bodily	functions	and	areas	God	has
not	ordained	that	we	should	control.	It	teaches	him	to	consciously	control	his
spirit	body,	which	then	controls	and	alters	what	is	happening	in	his	physical
body.	Again,	very	few	people	entering	such	programs	ever	realize	what	they	are
becoming	involved	in.	Christians	should	never	have	anything	to	do	with
biofeedback.	It	is	nothing	more	than	modernized	Yoga,	satanic	meditation	and
witchcraft.

witchcraft.
Another	area	often	overlooked,	but	very	powerful,	is	that	of	rock	music.	Rock
music	is	Satan’s	music.	Like	so	many	other	things,	the	whole	movement	of	rock
music	was	carefully	planned	and	carried	out	by	Satan	and	his	servants	from	its
very	beginning.	Rock	music	didn’t	“just	happen,”	it	was	a	carefully
masterminded	plan	by	none	other	than	Satan	himself.
As	mentioned	earlier	in	the	book,	Elaine	has	personally	met	a	great	number	of
the	rock	stars.	They	have	all	agreed	to	serve	Satan	in	return	for	money	and	fame.
They	have	received	all	they	wanted,	but	also	much	they	didn’t	expect.	Their	very
lives	and	souls	are	destroyed.	These	rock	stars	know	exactly	what	they	are	doing.
They	are,	step	by	step,	teaching	untold	millions	of	young	people	to	worship	and
serve	Satan.
Elaine	attended	special	ceremonies	at	various	recording	studios	throughout	the
U.S.	for	the	specific	purpose	of	placing	satanic	blessings	on	the	rock	music
recorded.	She	and	others	did	incantations	which	placed	demons	on	EVERY
record	and	tape	of	rock	music	sold.	At	times	they	also	called	up	special	demons
who	spoke	on	the	recordings	—	especially	in	the	various	backmasked	messages.
Also	,	in	many,	many	of	the	recordings,	the	satanists	themselves	were	recorded
in	the	background	(masked	by	the	over-all	noise	of	the	music)	doing	chants	and
incantations	to	summon	up	more	demons	every	time	one	of	the	records	or	tapes
or	videos	is	played.	As	the	music	is	played,	these	demons	are	called	into	the
room	to	afflict	the	person	playing	the	music	and	anyone	else	who	is	listening.
The	purpose	of	all	of	this?	Mind	control!	Mind	control	not	only	to	give	the
listeners	understanding	of	the	messages	about	Satan	conveyed	to	them	by	the
music,	but	also	to	prevent	them	from	recognizing	their	need	for	Jesus	and	the
salvation	He	died	on	the	cross	to	give	us.
Many	of	the	song	lyrics	are	themselves	actual	incantations	calling	up	demons
when	the	song	is	sung.	The	purpose	of	this	is	two	fold:	to	exert	control	over	the
listener	and	to	provide	the	listener	with	actual	incantations	he	or	she	can	use	to
send	demons	upon	another	person.	This	is	done	to	gain	revenge	by	afflicting
them	with	illness,	accidents,	etc.	and	also	to	help	influence	another	person	into
the	bondage	of	rock	music	itself.
We	highly	recommend	the	book	The	Devil’s	Disciples	—	The	Truth	About	Rock,
by	Jeff	Godwin,	published	by	Chick	Publications,	Inc.,	for	an	in-depth	study	of
rock	music.	This	book	is	an	excellent	tool	for	parents	to	use	to	gain	an
understanding	of	the	rock	music	their	children	are	involved	in.
All	these	doorways	must	be	closed.

All	these	doorways	must	be	closed.
“If	we	confess	our	sins,	he	is	faithful	and	just	to	forgive	us	our	sins,	and
to	cleanse	us	from	all	unrighteousness.”	I	John	1:9.
If	you	have	participated	in	any	of	these	things	you	can	simply	close	the	door	by	a
prayer	such	as	the	following:
“Father,	I	confess	to	you	my	involvement	in	______	.	I	recognize	that
such	a	thing(s)	is	an	abomination	to	you	and	detestable	in	your	sight.	I
humbly	ask	your	forgiveness	for	my	sin	in	this	area(s).	I	ask	you	to	lift
out	any	demonic	entrance	as	the	result	of	my	actions	and	to	cleanse	me
from	my	sins	and	close	the	doorway(s)	forever	with	the	precious	blood	of
Jesus.	I	ask	for	this	and	thank	you	for	it,	in	Jesus’	name.”
Then	I	recommend	that	you	address	Satan	and	his	demons	out	loud	in	a	manner
similar	to	the	following:
“Satan	and	you	demons,	I	have	asked	my	heavenly	Father	for	forgiveness
for	participating	in	____	and	have	received	it.	I	now	by	faith	close	the
doorway	of	that	area	of	my	life	to	you	forever	through	the	blood	of	Jesus
Christ	shed	on	the	cross	for	me.	In	the	name	of	Jesus	I	command	you	to
go	away!”
Cases	of	infestation	with	the	stronger	demons	will	often	need	to	have	help	from
another	person	or	persons	for	deliverance.	If	you	pray	earnestly	and	desire
deliverance	regardless	of	the	cost,	the	Lord	will	instruct	you	as	to	what	you	need
to	do,	and	He	will	set	the	captive	free.
I	will	give	some	examples	of	people	whom	I	have	dealt	with	in	my	medical
practice	who	have	been	terribly	affected	by	the	opening	of	such	doorways.	All
names	have	been	changed	to	protect	those	involved.	We	Christians	must
understand	an	important	principle	that	I	have	never	heard	clearly	taught	in	any
church.	Many	of	the	people	with	whom	we	share	the	gospel	are	literally	bound
by	demonic	spirits,	either	from	within	or	without,	so	that	their	wills	are	not	free.
They	cannot	will	to	accept	Jesus	as	their	Savior	and	their	minds	are	similarly
bound	so	that	they	cannot	understand	the	gospel	message.
“But	if	our	gospel	be	hid,	it	is	hid	to	them	that
are	lost:	In	whom	the	god	of	this	world	hath
blinded	the	minds	of	them	which	believe	not,

blinded	the	minds	of	them	which	believe	not,
lest	the	light	of	the	glorious	gospel	of	Christ,
who	is	the	image	of	God,	should	shine	unto
them.”
II	Corinthians	4:3-4
These	people	will	not	tell	you	that	they	are	bound,	indeed,	the	binding	is	so
complete,	that	in	most	cases	they	don’t	even	know	that	they	are	bound.	The
excuses	you	will	hear	when	you	directly	ask	someone	if	they	will	pray	with	you
to	accept	Jesus	are:	“I’m	not	ready	yet,”	or	“I’ll	do	it	later,”	or	“I	just	can’t	right
now,	don’t	push	me,”	and	many,	many	more.
But	Jesus	came	to	set	the	captives	free.
“The	Spirit	of	the	Lord	God	is	upon	me;	...	to
proclaim	liberty	to	the	captives,	and	the	opening
of	the	prison	to	them	that	are	bound.”
Isaiah	61:1
We	Christians	need	simply	to	take	that	power	and	authority	that	Jesus	has	given
to	us	and	use	it	to	set	such	captives	free.	The	following	are	some	examples	from
my	own	experience.
#	1)	Jane	is	a	35	year	old	nurse	from	my	home	town.	I	worked	with	her	about	10
years	before	when	I	was	myself	still	a	nurse.	I	ran	into	her	again	some	time	ago.
She	was	amazed	by	the	change	she	saw	in	me	and	as	a	result	I	was	able	to	sit
down	one	afternoon	and	share	with	her	what	the	Lord	had	done	in	my	life.	Her
response	was:
“You	know,	I	have	had	two	other	friends	over	the	past	five	years	who	also
committed	their	lives	to	Christ	and	changed	dramatically	from	being	dissatisfied
and	unhappy	to	joyful	and	filled	with	peace.	I	have	often	thought	I	would	like	to
do	the	same,	but	I	just	can’t,	so	I	don’t	think	about	it	anymore.”
“Why	can’t	you	commit	your	life	to	Christ?”	I	asked.
“Well,	I	can	see	the	benefits,	but	I	just	can’t.	In	fact,	I	find	myself	getting	very
anxious	and	restless	as	we	talk	about	it.	I	think	we	had	better	stop	now,	I	don’t
want	to	talk	about	it	anymore.”
Not	long	before	I	would	have	stopped	there.	But,	praise	the	Lord,	thanks	to	His

Not	long	before	I	would	have	stopped	there.	But,	praise	the	Lord,	thanks	to	His
training,	I	easily	recognized	all	the	symptoms.	So	I	persisted.
“Let	me	ask	just	one	more	question	—	when	you	try	to	think	about	Jesus,	is	it
kind	of	like	you	run	up	against	a	blank	wall	and	it	becomes	such	an	effort	to
continue	thinking	about	it	that	you	just	give	up?”
“Yes	that’s	it!	How	did	you	know?”
“Well,	I	have	been	in	God’s	training	school.	Tell	me,	what	occult	activities	have
you	been	involved	in?”	She	reacted	with	shocked	surprise.
“How	did	you	know	about	that?	I	haven’t	done	much,	but	I	did	visit	a	palm
reader	about	eight	years	ago	just	for	kicks.	I’ve	been	back	to	palm	readers	and
fortune	tellers	several	times	since	then	and	recently	have	been	doing	my
horoscope.	But	nothing	really	serious.”
“Well,	Jane,	that	‘superficial’	involvement	in	the	occult	has	been	enough	to	put
you	into	demonic	bondage	so	that	you	can’t	accept	Jesus.	But	I	have	good	news
for	you.	Jesus	came	to	set	the	captives	free	and	because	I	am	His,	He	has	given
me	His	power	and	authority	over	Satan	and	his	demons.	Now,	you	demons	who
are	binding	and	blinding	Jane,	I	bind	you	right	now	in	the	name	of	Jesus,	you
may	no	longer	operate	in	her	life!”
Jane	looked	startled	as	if	she	wondered	if	I	had	taken	leave	of	my	senses.	But	I
merely	changed	the	subject	and	talked	about	something	else	for	about	10
minutes.	Then	I	asked:
“Jane,	I	asked	you	once	before	about	accepting	Jesus	as	your	Lord	and	Savior
awhile	ago.	You	know	that’s	what	you	need	to	do,	how	about	praying	with	me
now?”
She	looked	surprised,	then	relief	flooded	over	her	face.
“You	know,	I	would	like	to	pray	with	you	now.	I	can	accept	Jesus.	I	don’t	know
why	I	didn’t	do	so	earlier.”
We	both	knelt	down	together,	and	another	captive	was	released	from	Satan’s
kingdom	of	darkness	and	entered	into	God’s	kingdom.	I	then	told	her	about	the
doorways	she	had	opened,	and	she	prayed	and	closed	them	to	Satan	forever	with
the	precious	blood	of	Jesus.
#	2)	A	20	year	old	girl	came	into	the	emergency	room	where	I	was	working	one
evening.	Her	complaint	was	that	she	was	afraid	that	if	she	didn’t	get	help	she

evening.	Her	complaint	was	that	she	was	afraid	that	if	she	didn’t	get	help	she
would	commit	suicide.	She	was	depressed	and	afraid,	she	felt	as	if	she	had
nothing	left	to	live	for,	her	life	was	empty	and	without	meaning.	After	talking
with	her	for	awhile	I	told	her	plainly	that	what	she	needed	was	Jesus	Christ	and
shared	the	gospel	with	her.	She	responded,	“My	parents	are	Christians	and	I	was
raised	in	a	church.	I	know	that	what	you	say	is	true,	but	I’m	just	not	ready	for
that	yet.”
“You	demons	binding	this	girl,	I	bind	you	now	in	the	name	of	Jesus,	you	may	no
longer	operate	in	her	life!”	As	I	said	this	she	looked	at	me	as	if	I	were	crazy,	but
quickly	forgot	about	it	as	I	changed	the	subject	and	talked	about	something	else
for	a	few	minutes.	Then:	“Susy,	you	just	admitted	a	few	minutes	ago	that	you
knew	that	what	I	was	saying	was	the	truth,	that	you	need	Jesus	in	your	life.	How
about	praying	with	me	now	and	asking	Him	to	become	your	Lord	and	Savior	and
Master?”
“Yes,	I’d	like	to	do	that.	No	one	really	asked	me	to	do	so	before.	Will	you	help
me?	I	don’t	know	what	to	say.”
So	Susy	prayed	with	me	and	started	on	the	road	to	eternal	life.	On	further	gentle
questioning	I	discovered	that	the	doorway	opened	in	her	life	had	been	a	brief,
one	weekend	experimentation	with	street	drugs	at	the	age	of	13	at	a	slumber
party.	That’s	all	it	took	to	bind	her	mind	demonically.	From	the	way	she
described	her	life	I	have	no	doubt	that	prior	to	the	time	I	met	her	she	had	had
many	opportunities	given	to	her	to	accept	Jesus	but	was	bound	from	doing	so.
#	3)	An	80	year	old	man	was	admitted	to	the	intensive	care	unit	with	a	very
severe	heart	attack	during	the	time	I	was	the	medical	resident	in	charge	of	the
unit.	After	examining	him	I	knew	he	probably	wouldn’t	live	for	very	long.	He
asked	me	how	he	was	doing	and	I	told	him	that	he	wasn’t	doing	very	well	that	he
had	had	a	very	severe	heart	attack.	He	turned	away	and	started	to	cry.	The
conversation	went	as	follows:
“Oh	doctor,	please	don’t	tell	me	that,	I	can’t	take	it!”
“Sir,	what	is	the	matter,	are	you	afraid	to	die?”
“Yes.”
“Do	you	know	what	will	happen	to	you	after	you	die?”
“Yes	young	lady,	I’m	going	straight	to	hell!”
I	was	most	surprised,	as	very	few	people	are	so	straight	forward.	“Please,	Sir,	let

I	was	most	surprised,	as	very	few	people	are	so	straight	forward.	“Please,	Sir,	let
me	tell	you	how	you	can	avoid	going	to	hell.”
“NO,	NO!	I’ve	heard	it	all	before	and	it	does	no	good.	Don’t	bother.”
“Well,	want	to	or	not,	you	ARE	going	to	hear	about	Jesus	one	more	time.”	I	then
shared	the	gospel	in	about	four	sentences.	Brevity	is	a	must	in	such	situations.
“I	know	it	all,	I	know	that’s	right,	but	I	just	can’t.”
“Sir,	just	repeat	three	words	after	me:	Jesus	save	me.”
“I	can’t,	I	can’t.	Go	away!”
“Sir,	I	know	that	you	are	being	blocked,	you’re	right,	you	can’t	say	those	words.
Tell	me,	do	you	know	who	is	blocking	you?”
At	this	point	he	turned	and	looked	me	straight	in	the	eye	and	said,	“Satan	and	his
demons!”
“I	have	good	news	for	you.	Jesus	came	to	set	the	captive	free	and	you	surely	are
a	captive.	But	I	am	a	child	of	the	King	and	I	have	been	given	His	authority	over
Satan	and	the	demons.”
I	then,	out	loud,	addressed	Satan	and	his	demons	and	in	the	name	of	Jesus	bound
them.	I	will	never	forget	the	joy	that	came	over	that	old	man’s	face.	He	took	my
hand	and	tears	streamed	down	our	faces	as	he	prayed	to	Jesus	asking	Him	to	be
his	Lord	and	Savior.	I	could	see	the	peace	spread	over	him.	He	looked	up	and
said,	“Young	lady,	I	have	been	longing	and	searching	and	wanting	to	come	to
Jesus	for	50	years,	but	could	not.”
As	I	talked	to	him	for	awhile	he	told	me	that	at	about	the	age	of	30	he	was
working	as	a	sailor.	His	ship	stopped	in	the	Philippines	for	awhile	and	during
shore	leave	he	had	become	involved	in	an	argument	with	some	of	the	local
people.	They	had	placed	a	voodoo	curse	on	him	with	the	result	that	he	had	been
seeking	Jesus	for	fifty	long	years,	but	was	bound	from	accepting	him	because	no
one	he	had	talked	with	knew	to	make	use	of	the	tremendous	power	and	authority
Jesus	has	given	to	us	or	to	recognize	what	had	happened	to	him.	The	next	day
when	I	went	in	to	see	him	he	was	much	worse	physically	but	he	was	radiant.	His
last	words	to	me	were:	“Young	lady,	I	have	perfect	peace.”	He	went	into	a	coma
and	died	shortly	after	that.
#	4)	A	44	year	old	woman	was	brought	to	my	office	by	her	friends	because	she
was	on	the	verge	of	committing	suicide.	Her	friends	brought	her	to	me	because
they	knew	that	I	was	a	Christian	physician	and	they	hoped	that	perhaps	I	could
help	her.	Her	story	was	no	different	than	so	many	I	have	heard.	She	was	born	to

help	her.	Her	story	was	no	different	than	so	many	I	have	heard.	She	was	born	to
Christian	parents	who	loved	her	and	she	knew	that	they	did.	But	somehow,	in
her	teens,	her	life	began	to	go	wrong.	She	began	to	run	around	with	the	wrong
crowd	at	school,	getting	into	all	kinds	of	illicit	sexual	relationships.	She
remarked:
“I	knew	that	what	I	was	doing	was	wrong	and	deep	down	I	really	didn’t	want	to
do	those	things	but	I	couldn’t	seem	to	help	myself.	I	had	been	raised	in	church
and	I	knew	what	was	right	and	wrong.	I	never	seemed	to	be	able	to	bring	myself
to	actually	accept	Jesus	and	commit	my	life	to	Him	as	my	brothers	and	sisters
did	—	I	never	knew	why,	I	just	wasn’t	ready	I	guess.”
By	the	time	she	was	17	she	had	already	had	a	baby	out	of	wedlock	which	her
parents	made	her	give	up	for	adoption.	Later	that	year	she	nearly	succeeded	in
committing	suicide	and	spent	three	months	in	a	psychiatric	hospital.	The	rest	of
her	life	had	been	spent	in	and	out	of	psychiatric	institutions.	going	to	numerous
psychiatrists	and	psychologists,	taking	innumerable	drugs	and	tranquilizers.
Nothing	helped.	She	was	unable	to	make	any	stable	relationships	or	experience
any	love.	She	had	a	second	child	out	of	wedlock	and	ran	away	from	home	at	the
age	of	19,	fearing	that	her	parents	would	make	her	give	the	second	child	up	for
adoption	also.	Finally,	two	years	before	she	came	to	see	me,	she	started
attending	a	church	and	eventually	accepted	Jesus.	Life	improved	then	over	the
next	year.	She	stopped	drinking,	and	was	able	to	hold	a	steady	job.	She	found
true	Christian	friends	who	spent	much	time	with	her,	helping	her	to	change	and
clean	up	her	life.	Her	joy	was	reading	the	Bible	and	praying.	Then	suddenly	one
day:	“I	felt	as	if	someone	had	slammed	a	door	shut	and	all	was	darkness.	I	could
no	longer	read	the	Bible	or	pray.	I	could	no	longer	sense	the	Lord’s	presence.	I
was	in	great	distress.	I	kept	going	to	church	because	I	knew	that	that	was	the
only	answer.	I	no	longer	had	any	joy.	I	have	talked	to	many	ministers	who	all
told	me	that	there	must	be	some	unconfessed	sin	in	my	life	or	that	the	Lord	is
putting	me	through	a	test.	But	I	know	that	I’m	being	destroyed.	I	no	longer	have
any	desire	to	go	on	living.	The	only	way	out	for	me	is	suicide.”
I	asked	her	if	she	had	ever	felt	as	if	there	was	something	inside	of	her	that	was
not	her,	but	that	controlled	her	actions	and	often	her	thoughts.	She	brightened.
“Oh	yes,	I	often	have.	I	really	think	that	there	is	something	inside	of	me	that	isn’t
me.	I	have	asked	several	ministers	if	I	could	have	a	demon	but	they	told	me	that
‘Christians	can’t	have	demons.’	I	guess	I’m	just	crazy	anyway.	The	psychiatrists
told	me	that	I	was	schizophrenic	when	I	tried	to	tell	them	about	this	‘thing.’”
Alas,	how	ignorant	so	many	people	are!	Sarah	did	indeed	have	a	demon	in	her,	a

Alas,	how	ignorant	so	many	people	are!	Sarah	did	indeed	have	a	demon	in	her,	a
very	powerful	one	with	many	lesser	demons	under	him.	The	Lord	instructed	me
to	search	for	the	key,	the	doorway	that	had	been	opened	to	the	demon.	At	the
Lord’s	leading	I	asked	Sarah	if	she	remembered	any	incident	from	her	early
childhood	that	was	very	traumatic	for	her.	After	thinking	a	few	moments	she
said:	“You	know,	it’s	funny	that	you	ask	such	a	question.	I	do	vaguely	remember
that	my	mother	mentioned	to	me	once	that	I	was	raped	when	I	was	a	little	girl.
She	would	never	talk	to	me	about	it,	said	it	was	best	forgotten.	I	remember	a
man	grabbing	me	and	throwing	me	to	the	ground,	but	all	I	remember	is	lying	on
the	ground	looking	up	into	a	beautiful	flowering	crab	tree.	I	don’t	remember
anything	else	about	the	incident.”
That	was	the	doorway.	The	demon	which	entered	into	her	while	she	was	being
raped	had	remained	in	her	undetected	for	many,	many	years	and	had	destroyed
her	life.	He	was	of	a	particular	class	which	I	will	discuss	later,	that	can	inhabit
body,	soul,	and	spirit,	all	at	the	same	time.	He	has	thousands	of	tentacles	which
he	winds	and	entwines	deep	down	into	each	area.	He	it	was	who	slammed	shut
the	door	in	her	spirit	so	that	she	could	no	longer	sense	God’s	presence.	The
growth	and	take-over	of	the	Holy	Spirit	was	something	that	he	could	not	tolerate
so	he	tried	to	turn	Sarah	away	from	her	commitment	to	the	Lord.
But	the	Lord	had	held	onto	Sarah	and	over	the	next	two	hours,	that	demon	and
many	others	which	were	his	subordinates,	were	cast	out.	At	last,	after	many,
many	years,	Sarah	was	set	free.	Again	she	experienced	the	sense	in	her	spirit	of
the	Lord’s	presence,	read	His	word	joyfully	and	for	the	first	time	in	her	life,
began	to	live	a	normal,	healthy	life	and	experience	the	love	of	Jesus	Christ	our
Lord.	I	was	again	reminded	of	Hosea	4:6	which	says,	“My	people	are	destroyed
for	lack	of	knowledge	.	.	.	”
#	5)	A	well	built,	35	year	old	man	came	to	my	office	with	the	following
complaint:	“My	life	is	being	destroyed,	it	is	falling	in	pieces	around	me.	I	can’t
put	my	finger	on	any	particular	thing,	but	I	know	it	is	happening.	I	am	dying.”
I	talked	with	him	and	questioned	him	for	over	an	hour	seeking	the	key.	His
health	was	excellent.	He	had	no	medical	problems,	did	not	feel	ill	in	any	way.
He	was	a	Christian,	although	he	did	not	have	a	deep	walk	with	the	Lord.	His
marriage	was	happy,	his	children	well,	his	relationship	with	his	entire	family
good.	He	had	a	good	job	in	which	he	was	happy.	Finally,	as	I	questioned	him
about	every	body	system	he	said:	“I	did	used	to	have	trouble	with	my	sinuses
until	about	three	years	ago,	but	haven’t	had	any	since.”
Interestingly,	he	had	told	me	that	it	was	over	the	last	three	years	that	he	had	had

Interestingly,	he	had	told	me	that	it	was	over	the	last	three	years	that	he	had	had
the	feeling	that	his	life	was	falling	apart.
“What	happened	three	years	ago	to	cure	your	sinuses?”
“Oh,	I	went	to	Dr.____,	,	and	had	acupuncture.	It	really	worked.	I’ve	had	no
trouble	since.”
That	was	the	key!	During	the	physical	examination	I	ran	an	electrocardiogram
(EKG)	on	him.	While	the	EKG	machine	was	tracing	out	his	heart	beat,	I
suddenly	felt	an	overwhelming	presence	of	evil	in	the	room.	Immediately	the
young	man’s	heart	stopped!	I	wasn’t	exactly	sure	what	I	was	dealing	with,	but	I
rebuked	the	evil	in	the	name	of	Jesus	and	his	heart	spontaneously	started	beating
again.	His	heart	had	stopped	beating	for	over	one	full	minute!	Afterwards	the
Lord	revealed	to	me	that	the	evil	I	had	felt	was	the	spirit	of	the	acupuncturist.	He
was	drawing	strength	from	the	patient,	even	to	the	extent	of	stopping	his	heart
briefly.	The	Lord	had	allowed	this	to	happen	at	that	particular	time	for	my
instruction.	Demonic	doors	had	been	left	in	this	young	man	through	the
acupuncture	needles	to	leave	him	open	to	the	control	of	the	acupuncturist	similar
to	a	hypnotist.	The	acupuncturist	was	drawing	strength	from	this	young	man	for
his	own	use.	That	is	why	he	had	the	feeling	his	life	was	being	destroyed.	It	was!
I	could	not	tell	him	what	was	happening.	He	would	have	thought	I	was	crazy.	He
was	a	superficial	Christian,	not	yet	ready	to	accept	the	fact	that	demons	even
existed.	I	asked	the	Lord	what	I	could	do	in	such	a	situation.
“Use	the	most	powerful	tool	you	have,”	was	His	answer,
“pray	mightily	for	that	young	man.”
Over	the	next	year	I	fasted	and	prayed	for	that	young	man	many	times.	Finally
after	a	year	the	Lord	spoke	to	me	one	day	and	told	me	that	in	response	to	my
prayers	He	had	delivered	him	without	him	ever	knowing	what	had	happened.
Shortly	after	that	I	saw	him	again	for	a	minor	problem	and	he	told	me	that	he
was	feeling	much	better.	Again,	Jesus	had	set	the	captive	free!
#	6)	A	24	year	old	young	man	came	under	my	care	because	he	had	tried	to
commit	suicide.	Rick	had	been	raised	in	a	Christian	home	in	a	loving	family.	He
fully	committed	his	life	to	Jesus	during	his	teens	and	had	had	a	very	close	walk
with	the	Lord,	hearing	Him	speak	to	him	in	his	spirit.	He	was	a	very	intelligent
young	man	and	after	college	had	entered	graduate	school	at	a	seminary	to
become	a	minister.	The	Lord	was	the	joy	of	his	life.
Suddenly,	about	a	year	before	I	first	met	him,	he	was	no	longer	able	to	commune

Suddenly,	about	a	year	before	I	first	met	him,	he	was	no	longer	able	to	commune
with	the	Lord.	He	found	it	almost	impossible	to	read	his	Bible	or	pray	and	was
completely	unable	to	sense	the	Lord’s	presence.	He	counseled	and	prayed	with	a
number	of	people	but	received	no	help.	He	began	to	have	much	difficulty
concentrating	on	any	of	his	studies	and	his	grades	fell	drastically.	He	finally
became	so	despairing	that	he	had	dropped	out	of	school	entirely	about	a	month
before	the	suicide	attempt.	He	felt	he	had	nothing	left	to	live	for.
I	questioned	him,	trying	to	find	the	doorway.	Finally,	as	I	asked	him	to	tell	me
about	everything	he	had	done	shortly	before	the	trouble	began,	he	related	the
following	story	to	me.
“Shortly	before	school	started	in	the	fall	a	year	ago,	I	drove	out	to	Denver,
Colorado.	My	mother	had	called	and	asked	me	to	come	because	her	mother	was
critically	ill	in	the	hospital	out	there.	I	took	a	few	days	off	from	work	and	drove
out.	On	arrival	in	the	city	I	headed	straight	for	the	hospital.	As	I	was	driving
through	the	city	to	the	hospital	I	suddenly	had	the	sensation	of	something	dark,
like	a	cloud,	dropping	down	over	me.	It	lasted	for	only	a	few	seconds	and	then
was	gone.	I	didn’t	think	anything	more	about	it.	When	I	got	to	the	hospital	I
found	out	that	my	grandmother	had	died	just	a	short	time	before	I	arrived.	I
stayed	for	the	funeral,	then	returned	home.”
On	further	questioning	he	told	me	that	his	grandmother	had	been	deeply
involved	in	witchcraft.	Many	members	of	the	family	had	tried	to	bring	her	to	see
her	need	for	Jesus	without	success.	That	was	the	doorway	—	inheritance.	At	the
death	of	the	grandmother,	the	powerful	demons	that	inhabited	her	were	passed
on	to	another	member	of	the	family.	Of	course	Satan	would	choose	Rick	as	he
was	preparing	to	enter	full	time	service	for	the	Lord.	After	deliverance	he	was
again	restored	to	full	and	free	communion	with	the	Lord.	A	simple	prayer	in
faith	by	his	parents	breaking	any	lines	of	inheritance	from	Rick’s	grandmother
would	have	protected	him	from	such	a	thing	—	but	they	lacked	knowledge.
I	know	that	many	people	will	say	that	Rick	should	have	been	protected	from
such	a	thing	because	he	was	a	Christian.	But	the	Bible	states	plainly	that	the	sins
of	the	parents	will	be	passed	down	to	the	children	even	to	the	third	and	fourth
generations.	That	is	why	God	so	strongly	warned	the	Israelites	against	any
involvement	in	the	occult.	Christians	need	to	be	aware	of	this.	If	they	are	aware
of	anyone	in	their	family	that	has	been	involved	in	the	occult	in	any	way,	they
should	ask	the	Lord	to	close	that	doorway	of	inheritance	with	the	precious	blood
of	Jesus	both	for	themselves	and	their	children.

I	want	to	outline	below	the	four	basic	steps	a	Christian	can	take	to	fight	for	the
salvation	of	someone	who	is	demonically	bound.	Many	parents	face	this	problem
with	their	unbelieving	children	who	are	involved	in	rock	music,	occultic	games,
drugs,	alcoholism,	etc.	These	steps	can	also	be	applied	by	any	Christian	to
anyone	for	whom	he/she	has	a	burden	and	is	willing	to	fight	for,	to	bring	them	to
the	Lord	Jesus	Christ.
#	1)	If	the	unsaved	person	is	living	in	the	same	house	as	the	Christian,	the	first
step	must	be	to	clean	out	the	house,	that	is,	if	the	Christian	is	in	a	position	of
authority	in	the	household.	Children	cannot,	obviously,	do	this	if	they	are	minors
still	living	at	home	with	their	parents.	This	situation	will	be	handled	at	the	end	of
this	section.
All	objects	used	in	the	service	of	Satan	(occult	objects,	rock	records,	occultic
role-playing	fantasy	game	material,	etc.)	are	“familiar	objects.”	(See	chapter	20.)
These	must	be	removed	from	the	house	as	they	provide	legal	ground	for	the
demons	to	use	to	bring	a	continuing	evil	power	into	the	house.
In	the	case	of	Christian	parents	dealing	with	their	rebellious	teenagers,	I	would
warn	you	that	you	cannot	just	go	into	your	child’s	room	and	make	a	clean	sweep
of	everything	that	you	feel	is	a	familiar	object.	You	must	communicate	with
them	first.	Bind	the	demons	in	them,	then	sit	down	and	talk	with	them.	Listen	to
their	rock	records	with	them,	carefully	examining	the	lyrics.	I	guarantee	your
kids	will	be	embarrassed	because	they	know	in	their	hearts	that	rock	music	is
rotten.	If	they	are	into	occultic	games,	sit	down	and	look	at	the	manuals	and
study	the	game	with	them	so	that	you	gain	an	understanding	of	what	they	are
doing	and	can	then	point	out	to	them	scripturally	why	it	is	wrong.	After	you	have
done	all	this,	then	destroy	all	the	records,	tapes,	game	materials,	etc.
As	mentioned	above,	Christian	children	who	are	minors	can,	in	faith,	ask	the
Lord	to	seal	such	familiar	objects	so	that	the	demons	can	no	longer	operate
through	them.
#	2)	You	must	realize	that	your	loved	ones	are	demonically	bound	and	blinded.
You	can	talk	to	them	for	years	telling	them	of	their	need	for	Jesus,	but	they	just
won’t	understand	you.	They	can	even	repeat	back	to	you	what	you	are	saying,
but	it	is	as	if	there	is	a	“scrambler”	between	what	you	are	saying	and	their	brain
so	that	they	cannot	really	understand	the	concepts.	The	“scrambler”	is	a	demon.
Also	their	wills	are	bound	so	that	even	if	they	do	understand	their	need	for	Jesus’
salvation,	they	cannot	will	to	ask	Him	to	become	their	Savior	and	Lord.

salvation,	they	cannot	will	to	ask	Him	to	become	their	Savior	and	Lord.
If	they	are	living	in	the	same	house	as	you,	each	day,	out	loud,	take	the
aggressive	against	the	demons	in	them.	You	can	do	this	in	another	room	where
they	cannot	hear	you.	Don’t	forget,	demons	have	very	sharp	ears.	Say	something
like	this:
“You	demons	binding____,	I	take	authority	over	you	in	the	name	of
Jesus	Christ	my	Lord.	I	bind	you	in	the	name	of	Jesus,	you	may	not
afflict	____	today.	My	house	is	committed	to	the	Lord	and	is	holy
ground.	You	are	a	trespasser	and	may	not	function	here.	I	bind	you	and
command	you	to	leave	in	the	name	of	Jesus!”
This	battle	will	be	a	daily	thing.	I	cannot	tell	you	how	long	the	battle	will	take,
only	the	Lord	knows	in	each	case.	Be	alert	to	the	fact	that	the	demons	can	speak
through	the	other	person,	often	being	very	rude	and	insulting	to	you	to	try	to
drive	you	away.	In	many	cases	it	becomes	necessary	to	rebuke	the	demon
directly	as	he	is	speaking	through	the	other	person	and	command	him	to	be
silent.	The	Lord	will	guide	you.
#	3)	You	can	ask	the	Lord	to	let	you	“stand	in	the	gap”	for	the	unsaved	person.
This	will	be	discussed	in	more	detail	in	Chapter	14.	See	Ezekiel	22:30-31.	Ask
the	Lord	to	let	you	stand	in	the	gap	for	this	person	in	order	that	their	eyes	may	be
opened	and	their	will	set	free	to	accept	Jesus.
#	4)	Lastly,	you	must	understand	the	wonderful	position	of	power	our	Lord	Jesus
has	placed	us	in.	Hebrews	says:
“Let	us	therefore	come	boldly	unto	the	throne	of
grace,	that	we	may	obtain	mercy,	and	find	grace	to	help	in	time	of	need.”
Hebrews	4:16
Scripture	shows	us	that	Satan	comes	before	God	and	petitions	Him	for	people.
The	account	given	in	Job	chapter	1	clearly	demonstrates	this.	Also	Satan
obviously	petitioned	God	for	Peter.
“And	the	Lord	said,	Simon,	Simon,	behold,	Satan	hath	desired	to	have
you,	that	he	may	sift	you	as	wheat:	But	I	have	prayed	for	thee,	that	thy
faith	fail	not:	and	when	thou	are	converted,	strengthen	thy	brethren.”
Luke	22:31-32
Satan	is	not	finally	thrown	out	of	heaven	until	the	12th	chapter	of	Revelation.
“And	there	was	war	in	heaven:	Michael	and	his	angels	fought	against	the

“And	there	was	war	in	heaven:	Michael	and	his	angels	fought	against	the
dragon;	and	the	dragon	fought	and	his	angels,	and	prevailed	not;	neither
was	their	place	found	any	more	in	heaven.	And	the	great	dragon	was	cast
out,	that	old	serpent,	called	the	Devil,	and	Satan,	which	deceiveth	the
whole	world:	he	was	cast	out	into	the	earth,	and	his	angels	were	cast	out
with	him.	And	I	heard	a	loud	voice	saying	in	heaven,	now	is	come
salvation,	and	strength,	and	the	kingdom	of	God,	and	the	power	of	his
Christ:	for	the	accuser	of	our	brethren	is	cast	down,	which	accused	them
before	our	God	day	and	night.”	Revelation	12:7-10
You	must	understand	that	Satan	stands	before	the	throne	of	God	petitioning	our
heavenly	Father	for	our	unsaved	loved	ones.	Satan	points	the	accusing	finger	and
says,	“See,	so-and-so	is	participating	in	rock	music	(or	whatever),	therefore	I
have	a	legal	right	to	his/her	soul	and	to	influence	his/her	life	and	to	send	my
demons	into	him/her.”
Because	God	is	absolutely	just,	He	must	grant	Satan	his	petition	if	it	is
uncontested.	But	we	as	heirs	and	joint	heirs	with	Jesus	Christ	have	more	right	to
petition	God	the	Father	than	Satan	does.	We	must	“boldly”	go	before	the	throne
and	counter-petition	Satan.	We	can	pray	something	like	this:
“God	and	Father,	I	counter-petition	Satan.	I	come	to	you	in	the	name	of
Jesus	Christ	my	Lord	and	lay	claim	to	this	person.	I	claim	him/her	as	my
inheritance	which	you	promised	to	give	to	me	(if	the	person	is	your	child,
or	spouse).	Satan	may	not	have	him/her.	I	ask	you	to	open	his/her	eyes	so
that	they	can	see	the	light	of	the	gospel	of	Jesus	Christ.”
If	the	person	you	are	petitioning	for	is	not	a	relative,	you	can	petition	on	the
basis	that	Jesus	Christ	commanded	us	to	make	disciples	of	the	whole	world	and
we	can	claim	that	person	for	a	disciple	of	Jesus	Christ.
Again,	you	must	understand	that	this	is	a	real	battle.	You	will	not	win	overnight,
but	you	do	have	the	power	and	authority	in	Jesus	Christ	to	win	in	the	end.

CHAPTER	14
The	Human	Spirit,	Standing	In	The	Gap,	And	The	Spirit	World

REBECCA	TALKS:
HUMAN	SPIRITS
Throughout	this	book	many	references	have	been	made	to	human	spirits.	This	is
a	very	important	concept	that	Christians	should	understand.	This	is	the	power
that	Elaine	and	many	others	like	her	developed	and	used.	Let	us	look	at	the
scriptures	that	touch	on	this.
“And	the	very	God	of	peace	sanctify	you	wholly;	and	I	pray	God	your
whole	spirit	and	soul	and	body	be	preserved	blameless	unto	the	coming
of	our	Lord	Jesus	Christ.”	I	Thessalonians	5:23.
Paul	teaches	us	here	that	we	humans	are	tripartite	beings.	That	is,	we	have	three
separate	parts	—	the	body,	the	soul	(which	is	our	conscious	intellect,	will,	and
emotions),	and	the	spirit.	He	plainly	states	that	all	three	must	be	cleansed	and
committed	to	Jesus,	and	that	Jesus	himself	must	enable	us	to	keep	all	three	parts
“blameless”	until	His	return.
Genesis	2:7	says,
“And	the	Lord	God	formed	man	of	the	dust	of	the	ground,	and	breathed
into	his	nostrils	the	breath	of	life;	and	man	became	a	living	soul.”
That	is,	Adam	lived,	and	became	aware	of	himself.	In	essence	our	self	is	our	soul
which	manifests	in	our	mind,	our	will,	and	our	emotions.
“	...	There	is	a	natural	body	and	there	is	a	spiritual	body.	”	I	Corinthians
15:44
This	is	a	much	overlooked	verse.	Our	spirits	have	a	form	or	shape,	a	body
corresponding	to	our	physical	body.	Few	people	other	than	the	satanists	or	those
involved	in	such	things	as	astral	projection	realize	this.	(See	figure	A.)

Figure	A

“I	knew	a	man	in	Christ	above	fourteen	years	ago,	(whether	in	the	body,
cannot	tell;	or	whether	out	of	the	body,	I	cannot	tell:	God	knoweth;)	such
an	one	caught	up	to	the	third	heaven.	And	I	knew	such	a	man,	(whether
in	the	body,	or	out	of	the	body,	I	cannot	tell:	God	knoweth;)	How	that	he
was	caught	up	into	paradise,	and	heard	unspeakable	words,	which	it	is
not	lawful	for	a	man	to	utter.”	II	Corinthians	12:2-4
“After	this	I	looked,	and,	behold,	a	door	was	opened	in	heaven:	and	the
first	voice	which	I	heard	was	as	it	were	of	a	trumpet	talking	with	me;
which	said,	Come	up	hither,	and	I	will	shew	thee	things	which	must	be
hereafter.	And	immediately	I	was	in	the	spirit:	and,	behold,	a	throne	was
set	in	heaven,	and	one	sat	on	the	throne.”	Revelation	4:1-2
These	scriptures	and	others	show	an	experience	perceived	in	the	person’s	spirit,
and	that	the	spirit	body	was	separated	from	the	physical	body.	Notice	that	when
John	stated	that	he	was	in	the	“spirit”	that	it	is	spelled	with	a	small	“s”	signifying
his	own	human	spirit.	Every	time	the	Holy	Spirit	is	referred	to	in	scripture	it	is
spelled	with	a	capital	“S”	as	in	Revelation	1:10:

“I	was	in	the	Spirit	on	the	Lord’s	day,	and	heard
behind	me	a	great	voice,	as	of	a	trumpet...	”
“For	the	word	of	God	is	quick,	and	powerful,
and	sharper	than	any	two-edged	sword,	piercing
even	to	the	dividing	asunder	of	soul	and	spirit,
...	”
Hebrews	4:12
Did	you	ever	wonder	why	it	is	necessary	to	divide	between	our	soul	and	spirit?
According	to	the	above	verse	there	can	be	a	division	made	(or	separation	of)	the
soul	and	the	spirit.
The	first	Adam,	before	the	fall,	could	relate	to,	and	see	the	spirit	world	as	easily
as	he	could	the	physical	world.	How?	By	the	use	of	his	spiritual	body.	This	is
demonstrated	by	the	ease	with	which	he	could	walk	and	talk	with	God	in	the
garden	of	Eden.	He	had	a	conscious	awareness	of	his	spiritual	body	the	same	as
he	had	a	conscious	awareness	of	his	physical	body.	His	soul	(conscious	intellect
and	will)	controlled	both	his	spiritual	and	physical	bodies.	But,	at	the	fall,
spiritual	death	took	place	—	that	is,	Adam	and	his	descendants	were	no	longer
consciously	aware	of	their	spiritual	body,	and	thus	could	not	commune	with	the
Lord	as	he	had	once	done.	(See	figure	B	&	C.)

Figure	B

Figure	C

As	the	Holy	Spirit	comes	in	at	rebirth	when	we	accept	Jesus	as	our	Lord	and
Savior,	our	spiritual	body	is	re-born,	or	rejuvenated	so	that	we	can	commune
with	and	worship	the	Lord	as	Adam	did	before	the	fall.	The	fact	that	it	is	through
our	human	spirit	that	we	commune	with	God	(with	the	help	of	the	Holy	Spirit)	is
clearly	demonstrated	in	the	following	verse:

“[Jesus	is	speaking]	But	the	hour	cometh,	and
now	is,	when	the	true	worshipers	shall	worship
the	Father	in	spirit	and	in	truth:	for	the	Father
seeketh	such	to	worship	him.	God	is	a	Spirit:
and	they	that	worship	him	must	worship	him	in
spirit	and	in	truth.”
John	4:23-24
Please	note	in	these	two	verses	that	when	God	is	referred	to	as	being	a	“Spirit”
the	word	is	spelled	with	a	capital	“S.”	However,	the	human	spirit	is	clearly
differentiated	by	spelling	it	with	a	small	“s.”	Therefore,	only	a	spirit	can
commune	(that	is	communicate	with)	with	the	spirit	world,	in	this	case,
worshiping	God	the	Father	who	is	a	Spirit.	(See	figure	D.)

Figure	D

Angels	are	also	clearly	defined	in	the	Bible	as	being	spirits:
“Who	[referring	to	God]	maketh	his	angels
spirits;”
Psalm	104:4

This	verse	is	also	quoted	by	Paul	in	Hebrews	1:7.
“But	to	which	of	the	angels	said	he	at	any	time,
Sit	on	my	right	hand,	until	I	make	thine	enemies
thy	footstool?	Are	they	not	all	ministering
spirits,	sent	forth	to	minister	for	them	who	shall
be	heirs	of	salvation?”	Hebrews	1:13-14
Satan	and	his	demons	are	also	spirits,	they	were	once	angels	in	God’s	service
before	they	rebelled.	Jesus	himself	defines	these	creatures	as	angels	and	thus
spirits.	One	scripture	reference	for	this	is	in	Matthew	25:41:
“Then	shall	he	say	also	unto	them	on	the	left	hand,	Depart	from	me,	ye
cursed,	into	everlasting	fire,	prepared	for	the	devil	and	his	angels.”
Matthew	25:41
So	we	see	from	these	scriptures	and	many	others	that	not	only	is	God	a	Spirit,
but	there	are	other	spirit	beings	as	well	called	angels	—	some	in	God’s	service,
some	in	Satan’s	service.
Our	spiritual	bodies	are	the	link	between	us	and	the	spirit	world	because	the
spirit	world	cannot	be	seen	or	measured	with	anything	physical.
Through	the	Holy	Spirit,	our	spirits	are	able	to	commune	with	and	worship	God,
but	the	scripture	in	Hebrews	4:12	shows	us	that	it	is	not	God’s	will	for	us	to
regain	the	conscious	control	of	our	spirit	bodies	while	we	remain	here	on	the
earth	in	our	sinful	condition.	This	is	why	the	sword	of	the	Spirit	severs	between
the	soul	and	spirit.	Once	this	severing	has	taken	place	the	soul	(mind,	intellect,
will)	can	no	longer	control	the	spirit	body.	This	is	also	why	the	Lord	is	so
adamant	in	I	Thessalonians	5:23	that	our	spirit	must	be	under	the	total
mastership	of	Jesus	Christ,	as	well	as	our	soul	and	physical	body.
There	is	an	intriguing	scripture	in	Revelation	18:11	&	13:
[Referring	to	the	fall	of	Babylon]	“And	the	merchants	of	the	earth	shall
weep	and	mourn	over	her;	for	no	man	buyeth	their	merchandise	any
more:	...	and	sheep,	and	horses,	and	chariots,	and	bodies,	and	souls	of
men.”
Why	the	difference	made	between	bodies	and	souls	of	men?	Because	there	is	a
phenomenal	amount	of	power	and	intelligence	in	the	spirit	bodies	of	humans
especially	when	those	spirit	bodies	are	under	the	control	of	their	soul.	Satan	has
been	working	steadily	down	through	the	ages	since	the	fall	of	Adam	to	gain	the

been	working	steadily	down	through	the	ages	since	the	fall	of	Adam	to	gain	the
use	of	these	spiritual	bodies	for	his	own	evil	schemes.	Men’s	physical	bodies	are
weak	and	really	are	of	little	use	to	Satan,	but	their	spiritual	bodies	under	the
conscious	control	of	their	souls,	are	very	different.
Satan’s	goal	is	to	teach	humans	to	again	regain	the	conscious	control	of	their
spiritual	bodies.	Many	do.	Once	this	is	achieved,	these	people	can	perceive	the
spirit	world	as	well	as	the	physical	world.	They	can	talk	freely	with	demons,
leave	their	physical	bodies	with	their	spirit	bodies,	and	with	full	conscious
awareness	go	places	and	do	things	with,	what	seems	to	the	average	human,
supernatural	power.	It	was	with	their	spirit	bodies	that	the	various	witches	and
warlocks,	without	being	physically	present,	would	pull	Elaine	and	myself	out	of
bed,	throw	us	across	the	room,	etc.	We	were	unable	to	see	them	because	our
physical	eyes	cannot	see	the	spirit	world.	God	does	not	want	His	people	to
control	their	spirit	bodies	in	such	a	manner.	If	we	did	so,	not	only	would	we	be
open	to	overwhelming	temptations	to	sin,	we	would	not	need	to	be	so	dependant
upon	Him	and	we	would	also	be	constantly	aware	of	Satan	and	his	kingdom.
There	is	a	special	class	of	demons	who	frequently	refer	to	themselves	as	“power
demons”	who	seem	to	provide	the	“glue”	so	to	speak,	to	establish	the	link
between	the	soul	and	spirit	body	enabling	the	person	involved	to	gain	conscious
control	of	his	spirit	body.	The	imagination	is	a	key	stepping	stone	to	develop	the
link	between	soul	and	spirit.	That	is	why	it	is	so	important	to	bring	every	thought
into	captivity	to	Christ	(2	Cor.	10:3-5).	A	good	example	of	the	imagination	as	a
link	with	the	spirit	world	is	found	in	the	occultic	role-playing	fantasy	games.
(See	figure	E,	F,	G	&	H.)	/
We	have	found	that	we	can	save	ourselves	much	time	and	effort	in	the	area	of
deliverance	if	we	make	it	clear	to	a	person	requesting	deliverance	(who	has	been
involved	in	the	occult)	that	this	power	demon	is	the	first	demon	we	will	ask	the
Lord	to	cast	out.	If	someone	is	not	really	serious	about	desiring	deliverance,	or	is
trying	to	deceive	us,	they	will	back	off	quickly	when	they	find	out	that	with	the
removal	of	this	demon	they	will	instantly	lose	all	their	ability	to	use	their	spirit
body.
I	have	also	found	that	this	is	a	very	overlooked	area	in	deliverance	and
frequently	this	doorway	is	left	open.	The	result	is	much	suffering	as	Satan	and
his	demons	will	continuously	harass	the	person.	If	the	person	being	so	tormented
will	simply	pray	and	ask	the	Lord	to	remove	all	their	ability	to	perceive	the	spirit
world	and	ask	the	Lord	to	sever	between	his	soul	and	spirit	(as	in	Hebrews	4:12),
they	will	gain	tremendous	relief	from	such	torment	by	the	evil	spirit	world.	After

they	will	gain	tremendous	relief	from	such	torment	by	the	evil	spirit	world.	After
this	the	person	will	perceive	the	spirit	world	only	when	the	Lord	chooses	to	give
them	such	perception.	Their	spirit	will,	from	that	point	on,	be	totally	under	the
mastership	of	Jesus	Christ.
We	Christians	also	must	be	very	careful	to	ask	the	Lord	to	take	complete	control
of	our	spirits.	Many	Christians	fall	into	the	trap	of	learning	to	control	their	own
spirits.	I	have	heard	many	say	“I	meditate	until	I	have	a	spiritual	experience,	or,
experience	God.”	Christians	do	have	experiences	in	the	spirit	—	visions	and
revelations	—	but	these	are	always	under	the	control	of	our	Lord	Jesus	Christ
and	never	controlled	or	initiated	by	the	person	himself.	If	a	Christian	is	able	to
control	when	he	has	such	spiritual	experiences,	then	I	would	have	to	say	to	him
that	I	would	seriously	doubt	that	his	experiences	came	from	God.	Most	likely
they	came	from	Satan.

Too	many	Christians	think	that	they	must	“blank	out”	their	minds	so	that	the
Holy	Spirit	can	speak	through	them,	or	“control”	them.	The	Bible	clearly	shows
us	that	we	are	to	actively	cooperate	with	the	Holy	Spirit.	Any	time	we	blank	out
our	minds,	the	spirit	speaking	through	us	is	most	likely	not	the	Holy	Spirit.
Multitudes	of	Christians	are,	and	have	been,	mislead	because	of	their	lack	of
knowledge	of	God’s	principles	regarding	their	spirits.	Many	so	called	prophecies
given	by	people	who	blank	out	their	minds	thinking	this	gives	control	to	the
Holy	Spirit	are	demonic	prophecies.	Too	many	Christians	are	mislead	in	this
area	and	accept	such	prophecies	because	the	person	prophesying	knows	facts
about	them	or	their	life	that	they	think	only	God	could	know.	They	forget	that
Satan	knows	every	detail	of	our	lives,	the	only	thing	he	doesn’t	know	is	the

thoughts	and	intentions	of	our	hearts.
There	is	currently	a	growing	teaching	amongst	the	Christians	of	America	which	I
consider	to	be	very	dangerous.	That	is,	that	“Our	soulical	man	should	be	placed
under	the	authority	of	our	spiritual	man	because	once	indwelt	by	the	Holy	Spirit
our	spirits	are	without	sin.”	There	are	two	things	wrong	with	this	teaching.	First,
the	only	way	the	soul	can	be	placed	under	the	authority	of	the	spirit	is	to
establish	conscious	contact	between	the	soul	and	spirit.	This	is	pure	witchcraft.	I
Peter	1:22	says:
“Seeing	that	ye	have	purified	your	souls	in	obeying	the	truth	through	the
Spirit	unto	unfeigned	love	of	the	brethren...	”
Note	here	that	in	this	verse	“Spirit”	is	spelled	with	a	capital	“S”	referring	to	the
Holy	Spirit.	Our	souls	are	“purified”	by	staying	in	subjection	to	and	obeying	the
Holy	Spirit,	not	our	own	human	spirits.
Second,	I	Thessalonians	5:23	clearly	shows	us	that	our	spirits	are	vulnerable	to
fall	into	sin	because	Jesus	must	keep	them	blameless	until	His	return.	The
keeping	is	an	ongoing	thing.	Look	at	that	verse	again:
“And	the	very	God	of	peace	sanctify	you	wholly;	and	I	pray	God	your
whole	spirit	and	soul	and	body	be	preserved	blameless	unto	the	coming
of	our	Lord	Jesus	Christ.”	I	Thessalonians	5:23
I	John	1:8-9	certainly	doesn’t	agree	with	this	teaching.	It	says:
“If	we	say	that	we	have	no	sin,	we	deceive	ourselves,	and	the	truth	is	not
in	us.	If	we	confess	our	sins,	he	is	faithful	and	just	to	forgive	us	our	sins,
and	to	cleanse	us	from	all	unrighteousness.”	I	John	1:8-9
Please	note,	God	does	not	exempt	our	spirits	from	the	vulnerability	to	fall	into
sin	in	this	verse,	or	in	any	other	verse	that	I	have	been	able	to	find.	The	purpose
of	the	severing	between	the	soul	and	spirit	is	to	separate	our	spirit	from	the
influence	of	any	of	our	natural	“self”	desires	which	reside	in	our	souls.	If	a
Christian	walks	in	submission	to	God,	he	will	not	originate	anything.	Instead,	he
will	wait	quietly	for	the	voice	of	the	Holy	Spirit	to	be	heard	in	his	spirit	and	then
act	only	according	to	the	directions	of	the	Holy	Spirit.	A	Christian	who	is	in
conscious	contact	with	his	own	spirit	will	not	wait	in	submission	for	the	Holy
Spirit	to	speak	to	him.	He	will	be	taking	the	initiative,	and	thus	the	voice	he
hears	in	his	spirit	will	most	likely	not	be	that	of	the	Holy	Spirit.
There	is	one	other	major	area	regarding	our	spirits	that	has	a	terrible	impact	upon
many	people,	but	is	not	taught	about	in	our	churches.	This	is	the	fact	that,

many	people,	but	is	not	taught	about	in	our	churches.	This	is	the	fact	that,
whenever	he	has	the	chance,	Satan	will	use	a	person’s	spirit	body	without	his
awareness.
“Whosoever	hateth	his	brother	is	a	murderer	...	”
I	John	3:15
I	often	wondered	about	this	verse	before	I	understood	the	spirit	body.	How	could
one	be	a	murderer	through	an	emotion,	hatred,	if	he	did	not	physically	do
something	to	bring	about	the	death	of	the	person	he	hated?
Hatred	is	a	conscious	sin.	As	such,	it	gives	Satan	legal	ground	in	our	lives	if	we
permit	it	to	dwell	in	our	hearts.	If	you	hate	someone,	Satan	can	step	in	and	use
your	spirit	body	to	attack	the	person	you	hate.	Such	an	attack	can	produce	all
sorts	of	illness,	accidents,	emotional	problems,	and	even	physical	death.	The
person	doing	the	hating	usually	is	never	aware	that	Satan	is	using	his	spirit	body.
The	person	being	hated	usually	has	no	idea	where	his	trouble	is	really	coming
from.	That	is	why	we	must	be	so	careful	to	ask	Jesus	to	cleanse	and	keep	pure	all
three	parts,	body,	soul,	and	spirit.	That	is	why	the	Lord	Jesus	gave	us	so	many
commands	to	forgive	one	another.	Forgiveness	puts	a	stop	to	hatred.	We
Christians	should	ask	the	Lord	regularly	to	clean	out	our	hearts	of	any	sin.
“Create	in	me	a	clean	heart,	O	God;	and	renew	a	right	spirit	within	me.”
Psalm	51:10
Again,	please	note	the	small	“s”	in	the	word	spirit	here.	Obviously	the	sin	in
David’s	heart	had	affected	his	spirit	also.
An	excellent	description	of	the	personal	experiences	of	some	Christians	being
terribly	affected	by	the	hatred	of	other	Christians	is	found	in	the	book	The	Latent
Power	Of	The	Soul,	by	Watchman	Nee.

STANDING	IN	THE	GAP
Are	you	willing	to	stand	in	the	gap	for	someone?
“And	I	sought	for	a	man	among	them,	that	should	make	up	the	hedge,
and	stand	in	the	gap	before	me	for	the	land,	that	I	should	not	destroy	it:
but	I	found	none.	Therefore	have	I	poured	out	mine	indignation	upon
them;	I	have	consumed	them	with	the	fire	of	my	wrath:	their	own	way
have	I	recompensed	upon	their	heads,	saith	the	Lord	God.”	Ezekiel
22:30-31
“Standing	in	the	gap”	can	be	done	in	several	different	ways.	Often	it	is	necessary
to	ask	the	Lord	to	let	you	stand	in	the	gap	for	a	particular	person	so	that	he	can
have	an	opportunity	to	hear	the	gospel	free	from	demonic	interference.	Again
remember	II	Corinthians	4:3-4:
“But	if	our	gospel	be	hid,	it	is	hid	to	them	that	are	lost:	In	whom	the	god
of	this	world	hath	blinded	the	minds	of	them	which	believe	not,	lest	the
light	of	the	glorious	gospel	of	Christ,	who	is	the	image	of	God,	should
shine	unto	them.”
In	Ezekiel	22:30-32	God	was	looking	for	someone	who	would	be	willing	to
stand	and	fight	Satan	and	his	demons	to	stop	them	from	blinding	the	people	so
that	they	could	see	their	need	for	a	savior.	Because	the	Lord	could	not	find	such
a	person	He	said	that	He	would	have	to	pour	out	His	wrath	and	punishment	upon
the	people	for	their	sins.	Ultimately,	Jesus	Christ	is	the	ONE	who	stands	in	the
gap	for	all	sinners.	That	is	why	He	came	to	earth	and	died	—	bearing	the
punishment	for	our	sins.	However,	Jesus	set	the	example	for	us.	We	cannot	pay
the	price	for	our	sins	or	any	one	else’s,	but	we	can	fight	for	them.	In	that	sense,	I
believe	we	can	stand	in	the	gap	for	them.
We	as	Christian	warriors	must	be	willing	to	stand	in	the	gap	and	fight	in	the
spiritual	realm	to	break	the	demonic	forces	blinding	the	unsaved.	Paul	makes	it
very	clear	in	Ephesians	6:12	that:
“For	we	wrestle	not	against	flesh	and	blood,	but	against	principalities,
against	powers,	against	the	rulers	of	the	darkness	of	this	world,	against
spiritual	wickedness	in	high	places.”
We	often	pray	a	prayer	such	as	the	following:

We	often	pray	a	prayer	such	as	the	following:
“Lord,	please	let	me	stand	in	the	gap	for	and	fight	for	him	so	that	his	eyes
will	be	opened	and	he	will	be	freed	from	demonic	bondage	so	that	he	can
see	his	need	for	Jesus.”
The	Lord	has	shown	us	yet	another	way	to	stand	in	the	gap.	Look	at	the
following	scriptures:
“Is	not	this	the	fast	that	I	have	chosen?	to	loose	the	bands	of	wickedness,
to	undo	the	heavy	burdens,	and	to	let	the	oppressed	go	free,	and	that	ye
break	every	yoke?”	Isaiah	58:6
“Bear	ye	one	another’s	burdens,	and	so	fulfill	the	law	of	Christ.”
Galatians	6:2
“Greater	love	hath	no	man	than	this,	that	a	man	lay	down	his	life	for	his
friends.”	John	15:13
The	above	scriptures	clearly	show	that	the	Lord	expects	us	to	help	bear	the
burdens	and	hurts	of	our	Christian	brothers	and	sisters	as	well	as	to	fight
whenever	necessary	to	free	them	from	oppression.	Standing	in	the	gap	is	one
way	of	doing	this.
Are	you	willing	to	stand	in	the	gap	for	your	minister?	If	he	is	really	teaching
Jesus	and	exposing	Satan	as	he	should,	he	will	come	against	much	opposition.
Servants	of	Satan	posing	as	Christians	will	be	attacking	him	with	their	spirit
bodies	and	many	demons	every	time	he	gets	up	to	speak,	and	at	many	other
times	also.	These	Satanic	servants	are	often	in	high	positions	within	the	church.
There	is	a	real	need	for	strong,	healthy	young	people	to	be	willing	to	stand	in	the
gap	for	their	minister	and	ask	the	Lord	to	let	them	fight	for	him.	In	other	words,
any	demonic	powers	directed	towards	the	minister	must	get	past	you	first.	This
will	mean	suffering	for	you	—	both	physical	and	emotional.	You	may	not
always	be	able	to	get	to	church	every	Sunday	as	a	result	because	you	will	be	too
ill	to	get	there.	This	may	mean	false	accusation	against	you	from	members	of
your	church	saying,	“You	are	sick	because	you	don’t	get	to	church.”	Are	you
willing	to	take	this	kind	of	accusation	and	keep	silent	as	to	the	real	reason	why
you	weren’t	there?	Standing	in	the	gap	for	someone	is	a	way	of	“laying	down
your	life	for	a	friend.”
I	do	want	to	make	one	thing	clear.	By	standing	in	the	gap	you	do	NOT	accept
anything	from	the	demons.	Your	purpose	is	to	stand	in	the	power	of	Jesus	Christ.
You	should	not	“accept”	illness	or	any	other	form	of	oppression.	You	must
rebuke	all	demonic	oppression	in	the	name	of	Jesus	Christ	and	forbid	it	from

rebuke	all	demonic	oppression	in	the	name	of	Jesus	Christ	and	forbid	it	from
afflicting	you	or	the	person	you	are	fighting	for.	That	is	the	whole	purpose	of
“standing	in	the	gap”	in	the	first	place.
You	can’t	put	yourself	in	the	gap.	Only	the	Lord	can	do	that	because	only	the
Lord	controls	your	spirit	body.	What	you	must	do	is	ask	Father	to	put	you	there
if	it	is	within	His	will	to	do	so.	You	must	be	willing	to	allow	Father	to	use	you	in
any	way	He	wants	for	the	benefit	of	another	person.	You	cannot	decide	how	you
are	to	be	used.
Let	me	make	one	point	clear.	You	will	rarely	be	consciously	aware	that	you	are
“in	the	gap.”	This	is	because	the	Lord	has	complete	control	of	our	spirit	bodies.
We	do	not	“see	the	spirit	world	at	all	times	like	we	do	the	physical	world.	Only
on	special	occasions	does	the	Lord	allow	individuals	to	see	the	spirit	world	and
then	usually	only	in	glimpses	or	for	short	periods	of	time.	You	know	you	are,	or
have	been,	in	the	gap	only	when	the	Lord	reveals	it	to	you,	or	by	the	various
problems	in	your	physical	body,	which	the	Lord	will	confirm	to	you	is	from
what	has	happened	to	your	spirit	body	in	the	gap.
Have	you	ever	experienced	a	time	of	intense	intercessory	prayer	after	which	you
felt	completely	exhausted?	That	is	because	while	you	were	praying	with	your
physical	body	and	mind,	God	had	taken	your	spirit	body	and	put	it	into	combat
with	the	demonic	forces	you	are	praying	against	on	the	battlefield	of	the	spirit
world.	The	fatigue	you	felt	is	mostly	a	reflection	of	the	stress	your	spirit	body
experienced.	Wounds	inflicted	in	your	spirit	body	are	often	manifested	by
various	symptoms	in	your	physical	body	as	well.	I	have	come	to	realize	that	our
physical	bodies	have	been	so	altered	by	the	onslaught	of	sin	that	they	can	cope
with	the	conscious	awareness	of	the	spirit	world	for	only	very	short	periods	of
time	without	becoming	excessively	weakened.	Witches	and	warlocks	grow	old
in	their	physical	bodies	at	a	much	accelerated	rate.	They	pay	dearly	in	their
physical	bodies	for	their	frequent	intercourse	with	the	spirit	world.
There	are	a	number	of	interesting	references	in	the	Bible	that	confirm	this.	Some
are	in	the	book	of	Daniel.	For	instance,	in	Daniel	chapter	8,	Daniel	starts	out	by
telling	us	that	he	had	a	vision	where	he	saw	the	spirit	world	and	spoke	with	the
angel	Gabriel.	At	the	end	of	his	time	of	experiencing	the	spirit	world	Daniel
says:
“And	I	Daniel	fainted	and	was	sick	certain	days;	afterward	I	rose	up,	and
did	the	king’s	business;	and	I	was	astonished	at	the	vision,	but	none
understood	it.”
Also	in	chapter	10:

Also	in	chapter	10:
“And	I	Daniel	alone	saw	the	vision:	for	the	men	that	were	with	me	saw
not	the	vision;	but	a	great	quaking	fell	upon	them,	so	that	they	fled	to
hide	themselves.	Therefore	I	was	left	alone,	and	saw	this	great	vision,
and	there	remained	no	strength	in	me:	for	my	comeliness	was	turned	in
me	into	corruption,	and	I	retained	no	strength.	Yet	heard	I	the	voice	of
his	words:	and	when	I	heard	the	voice	of	his	words,	then	was	I	in	a	deep
sleep	on	my	face,	and	my	face	toward	the	ground.	And,	behold,	an	hand
touched	me,	which	set	me	upon	my	knees	and	upon	the	palms	of	my
hands.	And	he	said	unto	me,	O	Daniel,	a	man	greatly	beloved,	understand
the	words	that	I	speak	unto	thee,	and	stand	upright:	for	unto	thee	am	I
now	sent.	And	when	he	had	spoken	this	word	unto	me,	I	stood	trembling.
Then	said	he	unto	me,	Fear	not,	Daniel:	for	from	the	first	day	that	thou
didst	set	thine	heart	to	understand,	and	to	chasten	thyself	before	thy	God,
thy	words	were	heard,	and	I	am	come	for	thy	words....	And	when	he	had
spoken	such	words	unto	me,	I	set	my	face	toward	the	ground,	and	I
became	dumb.	And,	behold,	one	like	the	similitude	of	the	sons	of	men
touched	my	lips:	then	I	opened	my	mouth,	and	spake,	and	said	unto	him
that	stood	before	me,	O	my	lord,	by	the	vision	my	sorrows	are	turned
upon	me,	and	I	have	retained	no	strength.	For	how	can	the	servant	of	this
my	lord	talk	with	this	my	lord?	For	as	for	me,	straightway	there	remained
no	strength	in	me,	neither	is	there	breath	left	in	me.	Then	there	came
again	and	touched	me	one	like	the	appearance	of	a	man,	and	he
strengthened	me	...	”	Daniel	10:7-18
Battling	by	our	spiritual	bodies	takes	a	tremendous	toll	on	our	physical	bodies	as
well.	As	we	come	against	demonic	forces	we	do	so	with	our	spiritual	bodies
rather	than	our	physical	bodies.	That	is	why	Paul	makes	so	many	references	to
the	fact	that	our	battle	is	not	against	flesh	and	blood.	We	cannot,	obviously,	fight
in	the	spirit	world	with	physical	bodies.	But	the	two	are	linked	together	by	God
so	that	what	happens	to	our	spiritual	bodies	inevitably	has	an	effect	on	our
physical	bodies.

BATTLING	IN	THE	SPIRIT	WORLD
We	have	touched	on	the	topic	of	our	spirits	battling	in	the	spirit	world	several
places	in	the	book	already	—	particularly	when	discussing	the	concept	of
“standing	in	the	gap.”	This	is	a	difficult	concept	to	grasp	because	it	is	something
that	is	completely	out	of	our	control	and	rarely	perceived.
Please	understand	that	we	ourselves	are	still	learning	about	this	whole	area.
There	are	many	deep	things	written	about	in	the	scriptures.	We	are	still	searching
and	seeking	God’s	enlightenment,	we	do	not	consider	ourselves	“experts”	but
are	simply	following	our	Master’s	command	to	share	here	what	we	have	learned
so	far.
Once	you	understand	that	your	spirit	is	a	living,	active	part	of	you	which	can
walk,	talk,	sing,	think,	pray,	praise	the	Lord	and	fight	in	the	spirit	world,	many
puzzling	portions	of	scripture	begin	to	be	more	understandable.	For	instance,
keeping	in	mind	the	fact	that	for	a	large	portion	of	each	day	we	must	give	our
mental	and	physical	efforts	to	the	business	of	being	righteous	and	earning	a
living,	caring	for	families,	etc.,	how	then	can	we	carry	out	the	following
scriptures?
“For	this	cause	also	thank	we	God	without	ceasing...”	I	Thessalonians
2:13
“Pray	without	ceasing.”	I	Thessalonians	5:17
Our	minds	simply	cannot	pray	or	thank	God	without	ceasing	24	hours	a	day,	but
when	our	minds	cannot,	our	spirits	can.
“...	but	live	according	to	God	in	the	spirit.”	I	Peter	4:6
Again,	please	note	here	the	small	“s”	signifying	the	human	spirit.	How	can	we
live	in	the	spirit	in	this	manner?	By	committing	our	spirit	to	God	to	be	used	by
Him	in	any	way	He	chooses.
Our	spirit	bodies	can	move,	think	and	talk	just	the	same	as	our	physical	bodies,
but	they	take	their	character	and	way	of	thinking	from	our	physical	bodies	and
souls.	For	instance,	if	you	do	not	know	the	scriptures	with	your	mind,	neither
will	your	spirit	body,	with	the	exception,	of	course,	that	it	is	much	more	in	tune
with	the	Holy	Spirit.	Several	times	Paul	tells	us	that	our	battle	is	not	“against
flesh	and	blood,”	but	against	spirits.	Since	our	physical	bodies	cannot	fight
against	spirits	in	the	spirit	worlds,	our	spiritual	bodies	must	do	the	fighting.	That

against	spirits	in	the	spirit	worlds,	our	spiritual	bodies	must	do	the	fighting.	That
is	why	it	is	so	important	to	daily	ask	God	to	put	His	armor	on	us.	This	battle	is
continuous	and	unrelenting	and	if	we	don’t	have	the	armor	of	God	on	our	spirit
bodies	as	they	fight	we	will	receive	many	terrible	wounds	from	the	“fiery	darts.”
(Ephesians	6)
We	cannot	put	ourselves	on	the	spiritual	battlefield	as	our	spirits	are	completely
under	the	control	of	our	master,	Jesus.	We	simply	tell	the	Lord	that	we	are
willing	for	our	spirits	to	be	used	in	this	way	if	He	wants.	Frequently	I	petition
Father	to	let	me	stand	in	the	gap	and	fight	for	a	particular	person,	but	the	final
decision	is	Father’s.	You	will	soon	learn	to	recognize	the	symptoms	of	fatigue,
pain,	depression	or	other	illness	in	your	physical	body	which	indicates	that	your
spirit	body	is	fighting	hard.
The	concept	of	our	spirits	being	separated	and	geographically	away	from	our
physical	body	is	strange	and	difficult	to	accept.	There	is	a	fascinating	scripture	in
which	Paul	describes	just	such	a	circumstance.
“It	is	reported	commonly	that	there	is	fornication	among	you,	and	such
fornication	as	is	not	so	much	as	named	among	the	Gentiles,	that	one
should	have	his	father’s	wife.	And	ye	are	puffed	up,	and	have	not	rather
mourned,	that	he	that	hath	done	this	deed	might	be	taken	away	from
among	you.	For	I	verily,	as	absent	in	body,	but	present	in	spirit,	have
judged	already,	as	though	I	were	present,	concerning	him	that	hath	so
done	this	deed,	In	the	name	of	our	Lord	Jesus	Christ,	when	ye	are
gathered	together,	and	my	spirit,	with	the	power	of	our	Lord	Jesus
Christ.”	I	Corinthians	5:1-4
Notice	here	that	Paul	uses	a	small	“s”	denoting	his	own	spirit,	not	the	Holy
Spirit.	Also	of	utmost	importance	is	the	fact	that	Paul’s	spirit	was	there	in
Corinth	only	with	the	“power	of	our	Lord	Jesus	Christ.”	(I	Cor.	5:4)	Paul’s	spirit
was	completely	under	the	control	of	the	Lord,	not	his	own	soul.
Normally	the	human	spirit	resides	within	the	physical	body.	However,	many
scriptures	show	that	the	human	physical	body	can	still	live	when	the	spirit	is
separated	from	it.	This	is	not	true	of	the	soul.	Once	the	soul	leaves	the	physical
body,	the	body	dies.	That	is	why	the	many	scriptures	referring	to	physical	death
refer	also	to	the	soul.	However,	there	is	a	peculiar	drain	on	the	physical	body
when	the	spirit	is	not	actually	within	it.
Through	the	years	I	have	been	involved	in	this	ministry,	the	Lord	has	shown	me
that	the	drain	on	our	physical	bodies	is	a	peculiar	one	in	that	it	creates	an	acute
loss	of	protein.	If	we	are	not	careful	to	increase	our	intake	of	high	quality	protein

loss	of	protein.	If	we	are	not	careful	to	increase	our	intake	of	high	quality	protein
during	times	of	intensive	spiritual	battle	we	will	become	weak.	The	scriptures
have	much	to	say	on	this	subject.
Ever	since	God’s	covenant	with	Noah	in	which	He	commanded	Noah	to	eat
meat,	Satan	and	his	demons	have	been	trying	to	stop	humans	from	eating	meat.
It	is	interesting	to	note	that	today’s	Hindus	and	many	other	Eastern	religions	(all
of	which	are	forms	of	demon	worship),	believe	that	the	success	of	either	a
medium	or	an	adept	whose	powers	come	from	the	demons	possessing	them,
depends	on	the	presence	in	their	bodies	of	a	subtle	fluid	called	“akasa,”	which	is
soon	exhausted,	and	without	which	the	demons	are	unable	to	act.	This	fluid,	the
Hindus	say,	may	be	regenerated	only	by	a	vegetarian	diet	and	chastity.
If	we	stop	to	think	a	moment,	we	will	see	that	the	final	straw,	so	to	speak,	which
brought	about	God’s	judgment	in	the	flood,	was	the	intercourse	occurring
between	humans	and	demons.	(Genesis	chapter	6)	I	do	not	believe	it	was	any
accident	that	God	commanded	Noah	to	start	eating	meat	after	the	flood,	knowing
full	well	the	spiritual	battle	Noah	and	all	his	offspring	would	have	to	go	through
to	keep	demons	from	controlling	them	and	their	lives.
As	we	study	the	Old	Testament	and	the	laws	God	gave	to	his	people	the	children
of	Israel,	we	will	find	that	the	spiritual	warriors	of	those	days	were	the	Levities
of	Israel.	Their	diets	were	clearly	high	in	beef	and	lamb.
If	beef	is	so	harmful,	then	why	did	Abraham	prepare	beef	for	God	himself	to	eat
when	He	came	to	visit	him?	Abraham	would	obviously	prepare	the	best	he	had.
(See	Genesis	18:1-7)
If	we	look	at	the	various	spiritual	warriors	of	renown	in	the	Old	Testament,	we
will	find	that	every	time,	before	they	engaged	in	a	great	battle,	God	prepared
them	with	the	eating	of	meat.	For	instance,	Elijah.	Please	note	the	menu
provided	for	him	personally	by	the	Lord	during	his	period	of	preparation	just
before	he	faced	all	the	prophets	of	Baal.
“And	the	word	of	the	Lord	came	unto	him,	saying	Get	thee	hence,	and
turn	thee	eastward,	and	hide	thyself	by	the	brook	Cherith,	that	is	before
Jordan.	And	it	shall	be,	that	thou	shalt	drink	of	the	brook;	and	I	have
commanded	the	ravens	to	feed	thee	there.	So	he	went	and	did	according
unto	the	work	of	the	Lord:	for	he	went	and	dwelt	by	the	brook	Cherith,
that	is	before	Jordan.	And	the	ravens	brought	him	bread	and	flesh	[meat]
in	the	morning,	and	bread	and	flesh	in	the	evening;	and	he	drank	of	the
brook.”	I	Kings	17:2-6

The	Lord	speaks	very	directly	through	Paul	to	this	point	in	the	New	Testament.
“Now	the	Spirit	speaketh	expressly,	that	in	the	latter	times	some	shall
depart	from	the	faith,	giving	heed	to	seducing	spirits,	and	doctrines	of
devils;	Speaking	lies	in	hypocrisy;	having	their	conscience	seared	with	a
hot	iron;	Forbidding	to	marry,	and	commanding	to	abstain	from	meats,
which	God	hath	created	to	be	received	with	thanksgiving	of	them	which
believe	and	know	the	truth.	For	every	creature	of	God	is	good,	and
nothing	to	be	refused,	if	it	be	received	with	thanksgiving:	For	it	is
sanctified	by	the	word	of	God	and	prayer.”	I	Timothy	4:1-5
I	have	searched	the	medical	literature	carefully,	and,	despite	all	the	publicity,
there	simply	are	no	good	studies	that	conclusively	show	that	red	meat	is	harmful.
(Please	note	I	am	referring	to	the	lean	meat,	not	the	fat,	which	the	Lord	told	the
Israelites	not	to	eat	when	He	gave	them	the	law.)	In	fact,	much	work	has	been
done	showing	the	merits	of	protein	supplements	in	a	very	wide	range	of
illnesses.	But	Satan	has	such	control	of	the	medical	field	that	it	is	extremely
difficult	to	get	the	average	physician	to	pay	any	attention	to	the	merits	and
necessity	of	protein.
If	you	will	stop	to	evaluate,	you	will	find	that	the	bottom	line	in	any	health	food
teaching	or	fad	is	the	abstinence	from	meat.	This	is	no	accident.	It	is	a	carefully
masterminded	plan	by	Satan,	because	he	knows	very	well	the	protein	needs	our
bodies	have	and	the	tremendous	protein	drain	caused	by	involvement	in	spiritual
warfare.	If	Satan	can	keep	God’s	warriors	from	eating	meat,	he	can	cause	much
weakness	and	illness	among	them	from	the	lack	of	protein.	The	physical	body
rapidly	loses	its	ability	to	fight	infections	when	deprived	of	protein.	Many
people	die	unnecessarily	in	these	days	of	“modern	medicine”	because	their
doctors	don’t	supplement	their	protein	intake.
During	times	of	intense	battling	we	often	find	it	necessary	to	eat	meat	at	least
twice	daily.	If	we	do	not,	we	rapidly	lose	strength	and	often	become	physically
ill.	I	have	worked	with	many	people	who,	when	under	intensive	attacks	by
witchcraft,	became	excessively	weakened	and	even	ill,	simply	because	they	did
not	know	about	God’s	simple	principles	regarding	the	needed	protein	intake.	All
of	them	were	much	improved	when	they	increased	the	amount	of	meat	in	their
diets.
When	you	are	experiencing	pain,	depression	and	exhaustion	from	being	on	the
battlefield,	(or	at	any	other	time),	don’t	forget	one	of	our	key	weapons	—	praise.
I	will	never	forget	the	night	Father	taught	me	that	lesson.	I	had	just	gone	to	bed
and	was	tossing	and	turning,	unable	to	sleep.	I	was	deeply	depressed.	I	was

and	was	tossing	and	turning,	unable	to	sleep.	I	was	deeply	depressed.	I	was
exhausted,	in	much	pain	and	everything	seemed	so	impossible.	Actually,	what	I
was	doing	was	having	a	pity	party	for	me.
Suddenly,	Father	allowed	me	to	see	through	the	eyes	of	my	spiritual	body	and	I
saw	that	I	was	on	the	battlefield,	(that	is,	my	spirit	body)	but	I	was	not	fighting.	I
was	down	on	the	ground,	surrounded	by	many	demons	who	were	all	jeering	and
throwing	stones	at	me.	I	did	not	care.	I	was	so	tired	that	I	hoped	those	demons
would	kill	me,	I	did	not	want	to	live.	There	was	nowhere	to	run,	no	way	out	of
the	situation	except	to	stand	up	and	fight,	but	at	that	point	I	was	too	tired	and
depressed	to	do	so.
I	do	not	know	how	much	Elaine	knew	of	what	was	happening,	but	I	do	know
that	it	was	in	response	to	a	command	from	Father	that	she	came	into	the
bedroom	at	that	point	and	put	on	one	of	our	tapes	of	Christian	music.	I	was	in	no
mood	to	listen	to	music,	especially	not	the	tape	of	all	praise	hymns	she	chose.
Elaine	did	not	say	anything	to	me.	She	simply	sat	and	listened	to	the	music.
Gently	and	persistently	the	Holy	Spirit	showed	me	how	wrong	my	indulgence	in
self-pity	was.	Once	again,	I	marveled	at	how	loving	and	gracious	the	Lord	is
when	we	fail	and	fall.	I	could	not	help	but	respond	to	so	great	love.	So,	as	I
started	singing	along	with	the	tape	in	my	physical	body,	in	the	spirit	world	I
struggled	to	my	feet	and	told	the	demons	I	did	not	care	what	they	did,	that	I	was
going	to	praise	my	Lord	for	His	incredible	love.	I	lifted	my	head	and	hands	and
arms	toward	heaven	and	sang	my	heart-felt	love	and	worship	and	praise	(in	both
my	physical	and	spiritual	bodies).	As	I	did	so,	suddenly,	in	the	spirit	world,	a
brilliant	white	light	shown	around	me.	I	saw	all	of	the	demons	fall	flat	on	the
ground	and	then	one	by	one	they	slunk	away	into	the	darkness.	Satan	and	his
demons	cannot	stand	in	the	presence	of	praise	to	the	Lord.	I	am	sure	that	is	why
Paul	wrote	that	much	debated	scripture	in	I	Thessalonians	5:16:
“In	everything	give	thanks	..	”
Please	note	the	word	is	“In”	not	“For.”	The	worse	our	circumstances	are,	the
more	sure	we	can	be	that	Satan	and	his	demons	are	all	around	us.	As	we	give
praise	to	the	Lord,	the	source	of	our	problems,	Satan,	will	rapidly	lose	strength
and	we	will	gain	much	blessing.
As	you	fight	in	the	spiritual	realm	remember	that	every	weapon	and	tactic	of
warfare	mentioned	in	the	Bible	is	available	to	us.	The	Psalms	are	especially
helpful.	Don’t	forget	to	ask	Father	to	put	your	feet	on	“The	Rock”	which	is
Jesus,	and	your	back	to	“The	Rock.”	The	Lord	will	show	you	and	teach	you	step
by	step	what	you	need	to	know.

Are	you	willing	to	serve	the	Lord	in	this	way?	?

CHAPTER	15
Why	Should	We	Fight?

REBECCA	TALKS:
The	question	we	get	from	so	many	people	is	“Why	should	we	fight?”	So	many
Christians	today	are	living	exceedingly	comfortable	lives	and	quite	naturally
they	don’t	want	their	comfort	disturbed.	They	say,	“Why	should	we	even	have	to
fight?	After	all,	Christ	won	the	complete	victory	for	us	on	the	cross.	So	why
should	Christians	have	to	think	about	becoming	soldiers	and	warriors?	All
Christians	have	to	do	is	claim	the	victory	Jesus	has	already	won.”	This	is	the
issue	I	wish	to	address	here.
Let	us	first	look	at	what	Jesus	Himself	had	to	say	about	this	subject	when	He
was	here	on	earth.	I	don’t	think	we	can	go	to	a	better	source.
“Think	not	that	I	am	come	to	send	peace	on	earth:	I	came	not	to	send
peace,	but	a	sword.	For	I	am	come	to	set	a	man	at	variance	against	his
father,	and	the	daughter	against	her	mother,	and	the	daughter-in-law
against	her	mother-in-law.	And	a	man’s	foes	shall	be	they	of	his	own
household.	He	that	loveth	father	or	mother	more	than	me	is	not	worthy	of
me:	and	he	that	loveth	son	or	daughter	more	than	me	is	not	worthy	of	me.
And	he	that	taketh	not	his	cross,	and	followeth	after	me,	is	not	worthy	of
me.	He	that	findeth	his	life	shall	lose	it:	and	he	that	loseth	his	life	for	my
sake	shall	find	it.”	Matthew	10:34-39
Please	note	where	Jesus	said	in	verse	34	“Think	not	that	I	am	come	to	send
peace	on	earth:	I	came	not	to	send	peace,	but	a	sword.”	This	cuts	directly	across
the	“peace	and	love	gospel”	that	is	being	taught	so	widely.	Then	in	verse	39
Jesus	says	“He	that	findeth	his	life	shall	lose	it:	and	he	that	loseth	his	life	for	my
sake	shall	find	it.”	Christianity	involves	violence	if	we	practice	it	the	way	God
wants	us	to.	Losing	our	lives	does	not	involve	peaceful	co-existence	with	the
world.
“Behold,	I	send	you	forth	as	sheep	in	the	midst
of	wolves:	be	ye	therefore	wise	as	serpents,	and
harmless	as	doves.	But	beware	of	men:	for	they
will	deliver	you	up	to	the	councils,	and	they	will
scourge	you	in	their	synagogues;	And	ye	shall

be	brought	before	governors	and	kings	for	my
sake,	for	a	testimony	against	them	and	the
Gentiles.	But	when	they	deliver	you	up,	take	no
thought	how	or	what	ye	shall	speak:	for	it	shall
be	given	you	in	that	same	hour	what	ye	shall
speak.	For	it	is	not	ye	that	speak,	but	the	Spirit
of	your	Father	which	speaketh	in	you.	And	the
brother	shall	deliver	up	the	brother	to	death,	and
the	father	the	child:	and	the	children	shall	rise
up	against	their	parents,	and	cause	them	to	be
put	to	death.	And	ye	shall	be	hated	of	all	men
for	my	name’s	sake:	but	he	that	endureth	to	the
end	shall	be	saved.	But	when	they	persecute
you	in	this	city,	flee	ye	into	another:	for	verily	I
say	unto	you,	Ye	shall	not	have	gone	over	the
cities	of	Israel,	till	the	Son	of	man	be	come.	The
disciple	is	not	above	this	master,	nor	the	servant
above	his	lord.”
Matthew	10:16-24
We	must	“endure	to	the	end.”	Jesus	certainly	doesn’t	promise	us	a	“free	ride”	as
so	many	people	think.
“For	we	wrestle	not	against	flesh	and	blood,	but	against	principalities,
against	powers,	against	the	rulers	of	the	darkness	of	this	world,	against
spiritual	wickedness	in	high	places.”	Ephesians	6:12
Here	Paul	is	placing	the	emphasis	of	our	fighting	in	the	spiritual	world.	In
Matthew	10:14-16	Jesus	is	talking	about	the	physical	world	and	physical
persecution.	Paul	here	is	emphasizing	the	spiritual	world.	The	two	are	linked,	but
in	our	day	and	in	this	country,	physical	persecution	is	not	yet	very	strong	in	most
areas.	I	have	no	doubt	that	such	persecution	is	coming	shortly.	In	the	meantime
our	battle	is	primarily	in	the	spiritual	realm.
“Thou	therefore	endure	hardness,	as	a	good	soldier	of	Jesus	Christ.	No
man	that	warreth	entangleth	himself	with	the	affairs	of	this	life;	that	he
may	please	him	who	hath	chosen	him	to	be	a	soldier.”	II	Timothy	2:3-4
“Beloved,	when	I	gave	all	diligence	to	write	unto	you	of	the	common
salvation,	it	was	needful	for	me	to	write	unto	you,	and	exhort	you	that	ye
should	earnestly	contend	[to	fight	for]	for	the	faith	which	was	once
delivered	unto	the	saints.”	Jude	3

delivered	unto	the	saints.”	Jude	3
Why	should	we	fight?	The	obvious	answer	is	because	God	wants	us	to.	These
and	many,	many	other	scriptures	make	God’s	will	plain.	But,	many	people	ask,
“Why	would	God	want	us	to	fight	when	He	has	already	fought	the	battle	for	us?”
I	have	sought	the	Lord	earnestly	for	the	answer	to	this	question.	Of	course,	in
thinking	about	all	of	this,	I	had	to	ask	myself	the	same	question.	Why	have	I
suffered	and	lost	so	much	to	fight	in	this	battle	if	it	is	not	necessary?	I	wish	to
submit	to	you	here	the	answer	the	Lord	gave	to	me	for	this	question.
The	basic	reason,	is	because	I	have	made	a	commitment.	You	see,	unfortunately,
when	the	gospel	is	preached	in	this	day,	it’s	preached	“Jesus	died	for	your	sins,
ask	Him	to	forgive	your	sins,	and	everything	will	be	wonderful.”	Nothing	is	said
about	the	fact	that	you	can’t	get	Jesus	to	forgive	your	sins	without	making	a
commitment	to	Him.	The	way	the	gospel	has	been	preached	for	so	many	years	is
that	salvation	is	a	one-way	street.	Jesus	does	it	all	and	you	don’t	have	to	do
anything.
That’s	not	true.	That’s	not	what	Jesus	Himself	said.	He	said	that	if	you	do	not
take	up	your	cross	and	deny	yourself,	and	perhaps	even	get	killed	for	your	belief
in	Him,	you’re	not	worthy	of	Him.	He	says	He’s	going	to	give	salvation	to	those
who	endure	to	the	end.	He	makes	no	promise	to	give	salvation	and	eternal	life	to
those	who	don’t	endure.	This	concept	is	repeated	by	Paul	many	times	in	the
book	of	Hebrews.	For	example:
“But	Christ	as	a	son	over	his	own	house;	whose
house	are	we,	if	we	hold	fast	the	confidence	and
the	rejoicing	of	the	hope	firm	unto	the	end.”
Hebrews	3:6.	“For	we	are	made	partakers	of
Christ	if	we	hold	the	beginning	of	our
confidence	stedfast	unto	the	end.”
Hebrews	3:14
We	can’t	be	saved	by	works,	but	salvation	is	more	than	just	saying	“Jesus	please
forgive	me”	and	then	going	on	our	merry	way.	It	is	a	total	and	complete
commitment	to	Jesus.	We	literally	sell	ourselves	to	God	just	as	much	as	people
in	Satanism	sell	themselves	to	Satan.	We	are	then	a	debtor.	We	are	bought	and
paid	for	and	we	no	longer	belong	to	ourselves.	We	no	longer	have	any	rights.

We	are	servants.	The	word	commitment	is	neither	taught	nor	practiced	today,
most	people	don’t	even	know	what	the	word	commitment	means.
Commitment	is	not	a	“work.”	Commitment	is	a	contract,	it	is	a	literal	selling	of
yourself.	Paul	says	in	Romans	that	he	is	a	debtor.	(Romans	1:14)	Christ	bought
Paul	even	as	He	bought	us.	Salvation	is	a	sale,	it	is	a	transaction.	Commitment	is
not	a	work,	it	is	actually	a	sale.	Jesus	bought	and	paid	for	us,	otherwise	we
would	belong	to	Satan	and	would	go	to	hell.	The	only	way	out	is	through	a	sale.
What	a	terrible	price	Jesus	had	to	pay	for	us!
I	don’t	think	enough	people	understand	this.	The	amount	Satan	attacks	us	seems
to	be	directly	dependant	upon	how	we	abide	by	this	sale	—	that	is,	the	level	of
our	commitment	to	the	Lord.
Job	was	totally	committed.	Only	God	can	know	the	degree	to	which	you	have
sold	out	to	Jesus.	God	knew	Job’s	heart,	He	knew	Job	was	totally	committed	to
Him.	That’s	the	reason	God	was	willing	to	take	up	Satan’s	challenge	because
God	knew	that	Job	would	stand.	God	knew	that	Jesus	would	stand,	because
when	Jesus	was	here	in	human	form,	(Phil.	2)	He	was	totally	committed	to	the
Father.	Therefore	God	the	Father	knew	that	His	son	Jesus	Christ	would	stand	to
the	point	of	death,	which	He	did,	and	not	just	His	own	death,	but	He	suffered
terribly	for	all	the	rest	of	us.
Satan	hates	Jesus	more	than	anything	else	because	Jesus	now	has	the	legal
ownership	of	the	world	and	shortly	will	take	up	that	ownership	and	will
dispossess	Satan	of	his	kingdom.	We	don’t	have	any	concept	of	just	how	intense
and	deep	Satan’s	hatred	for	God	is.	You	see,	the	instant	we	make	a	conversion,	a
commitment	asking	Jesus	to	purchase	us,	we	become	Jesus’	property	—	then
Satan	hates	us	the	same	as	he	hates	Jesus.	That’s	the	reason	why,	the	moment	we
are	truly	saved,	we	are	head-over-heels	in	a	phenomenal	battle.	Satan	plans	to
destroy	us.	Jesus	told	us	that.
“If	the	world	hate	you,	ye	know	that	it	hated	me
before	it	hated	you.	If	ye	were	of	the	world,	the
world
would	love	his	own:	but	because	ye	are	not	of
the
world,	but	I	have	chosen	you	out	of	the	world,
therefore
the	world	hateth	you.	Remember	the	word	that	I
said	unto	you,	The	servant	is	not	greater	than	his

said	unto	you,	The	servant	is	not	greater	than	his
lord.
If	they	have	persecuted	me,	they	will	also
persecute
you;	if	they	have	kept	my	saying,	they	will	keep
yours
also.	But	all	these	things	will	they	do	unto	you
for	my
name’s	sake,	because	they	know	not	him	that
sent	me.
If	I	had	not	come	and	spoken	unto	them,	they
had	not
had	sin:	but	now	they	have	no	cloke	for	their
sin.”
John	15:18-22
There	are	two	key	points	here.	Jesus	is	telling	us	very	clearly	that	the	instant	we
become	identified	with	Him	as	we	will	when	we	become	His	property	(i.e.
servants),	then	the	world,	which	is	currently	under	Satan’s	control,	will	hate	us
in	exactly	the	same	manner	as	it	hates	Jesus.	Secondly,	so	many	people	say,
“Why	should	I	have	to	suffer	or	die,	after	all,	Jesus	won	the	victory	on	the	cross
and	suffered	for	me,	therefore	suffering	is	not	necessary	for	me.”	But	what	did
Jesus	say?	He	said,	“I	have	said	unto	you,	the	servant	is	not	greater	than	his	lord.
If	they	have	persecuted	me,	they	will	also	persecute	you	...”	(verse	20)	Anyone
who	tells	me	that	he	should	not	have	to	suffer	because	Jesus	did	it	all	on	the
cross	is	really	saying	that	he	is	greater	than	his	master!	The	master	in	this
instance	being	Jesus	Christ.	He	is	absolutely	going	against	the	words	Jesus
himself	spoke.	This	“no	suffering,	health	and	wealth”	doctrine	which	is	being
taught	across	our	land	is	a	doctrine	of	demons;	let’s	label	it	for	what	it	is.
The	gospel	is	not	really	being	presented	in	full.	When	have	you	heard	any
evangelist	get	up	and	say	“You	can	have	salvation,	but	only	under	one	condition,
that	you	are	totally	committed,	totally	sold	to	Christ,	you	don’t	have	any
personal	rights,	you	no	longer	belong	to	yourself,	you	no	longer	have	any	right
to	anything.	You	will	become	a	servant.	You	are	in	essence	signing	your	own
death	warrant	because	Satan	will	hate	you	and	try	to	kill	you.	You	ARE	gaining
eternal	life	and	citizenship	in	heaven.	You	give	up	your	life	here	on	earth	to	gain
eternal	life	in	heaven.”	How	many	preachers	do	you	know	who	present	this?
How	many	tracts	present	this?	NONE!

Why	does	Satan	and	the	world	hate	Jesus	so	much?	Because	once	He	came	they
“	...	now	have	no	cloke	for	their	sin.”	(vs.	23)
“[Jesus	speaking]	And	this	is	the	condemnation,
that	light	is	come	into	the	world,	and	men	loved
darkness	rather	than	light,	because	their	deeds
were	evil.”
John	3:19
We	must	understand	that	when	we	accept	Jesus	as	our	Savior,	our	Lord	and	our
Master,	we	are	accepting	citizenship	in	heaven	and	death	here	on	earth.	I
personally	don’t	believe	we	can	really	have	salvation	under	any	other	conditions.
Total	commitment	is	what	Jesus	demands	over	and	over	again	throughout	the
gospels.	I’m	afraid	that	there	are	an	awful	lot	of	people	who	are	going	to	find	out
that	they	are	not	really	saved.	The	gospel	has	never	fully	been	presented	to	them.
This	is	why	you	cannot	separate	warfare	from	salvation.	True	salvation	is	going
to	put	you	into	direct	conflict	with	Satan.	I	know	I	came	into	direct	conflict	with
Satan	the	day	I	made	a	total	commitment	to	Christ	in	my	freshman	year	of
medical	school.	Four	years	later	when	the	Lord	asked	me	if	I	was	willing	to
commit	my	life	to	Him	to	be	used	in	any	way	HE	chose	to	directly	fight	against
Satan,	I	really	wasn’t	making	a	different	commitment.	The	Lord	was	challenging
me	as	to	how	willing	I	was	to	stand	by	the	commitment	I	had	originally	made.
He	was	opening	my	understanding	to	what	was	involved	in	that	commitment.	By
identifying	myself	with	Christ,	I	had	made	Satan	my	bitter	enemy.
Over	and	over	and	over	again	Jesus	tells	us	that	we	must	follow	Him	to	the	point
of	dying.	Let	us	look	at	a	couple	more	scriptures.
“If	any	man	come	to	me,	and	hate	not	his	father,	and	mother,	and	wife,
and	children,	and	brethren,	and	sisters,	yea,	and	his	own	life	also,	he
cannot	be	my	disciple.	And	whosoever	doth	not	bear	his	cross,	and	come
after	me,	cannot	be	my	disciple.”	Luke	14:26-27
Now	what	does	it	mean	to	bear	your	cross?	Most	people	interpret	this	as	putting
up	with	“bad”	things	that	come	their	way,	if	they	think	about	it	at	all.	Let’s	look
at	Matthew	16:
“Then	said	Jesus	unto	his	disciples,	If	any	man	will	come	after	me,	let
him	deny	himself,	and	take	up	his	cross,	and	follow	me.	For	whosoever
will	save	his	life	shall	lose	it:	and	whosoever	will	lose	his	life	for	my

will	save	his	life	shall	lose	it:	and	whosoever	will	lose	his	life	for	my
sake	shall	find	it.	For	what	is	a	man	profited,	if	he	shall	gain	the	whole
world,	and	lose	his	own	soul?	or	what	shall	a	man	give	in	exchange	for
his	soul?	For	the	Son	of	man	shall	come	in	the	glory	of	his	Father	with
his	angels;	and	then	he	shall	reward	every	man	according	to	his	works.”
Matthew	16:24-27
I	submit	to	you	that	the	cross	is	an	instrument	of	death.	It’s	not	just	bearing
trials	here	on	earth,	the	cross	means	literally	our	death.	So	then	what	does	it
mean	to	die?	To	me	this	means	that	in	making	this	commitment	to	God	I	have
committed	everything	that	matters	to	me	into	His	hands.	All	belongs	to	Him.	The
instant	I	do	this	I	know	that	Satan	is	going	to	petition	God	for	it	and,	as	in	Job’s
case,	Father	may	very	well	grant	Satan	his	petition.	To	me,	dying	daily	means
that	I	am	literally,	day-by-day,	going	to	lose	everything	that	I	love	on	the	face	of
this	earth.	God	does	not	always	require	that	of	everyone,	but	most	people	are
simply	not	willing	for	this	sort	of	commitment,	they	are	not	willing	to	take	up
their	cross.
Once	Christ	purchases	us	we	become	aliens	here	on	earth	and	there	is	a	barrier
between	us	and	everything	here	on	earth	—	Jesus	Christ.	Nothing	here	on	earth
belongs	to	us.	This	is	very	painful.	The	cross	is	probably	the	most	painful
method	of	dying.	So	what	we	are	doing	is	committing	ourself	to	a	life	of	pain,
taking	up	our	cross	daily	is	painful;	it	is	just	that	simple.	This	is	not	the	way
most	people	wish	to	present	the	gospel,	but	this	is	how	Jesus	presented	it.	Let	me
make	one	point	clear,	you	cannot	do	the	work	of	the	cross,	only	God	can.	In
other	words,	those	people	who	inflict	pain	upon	themselves	thinking	this	is	the
way	of	the	cross	are	completely	in	error.	We	are	servants,	we	simply	obey	the
commands	of	our	master,	we	do	not	decide	what	suffering	we	must	bear.
I	suggest	that	everyone	making	a	commitment	to	the	Lord	sit	down	and	take	a
sheet	of	paper	and	write	down	every	area	of	his	or	her	life	that	they	can	think	of.
Such	things	as	schooling,	career,	who	your	friends	will	be,	if	you	will	have	any
friends,	what	will	happen	to	your	family,	what	will	happen	to	your	physical
body,	where	and	how	you	will	live,	what	will	happen	to	your	reputation,	if	you
will	have	any	money,	etc.	This	is	not	an	easy	commitment	to	make.	As	soon	as
you	make	a	commitment	like	that	you	are	going	to	be	tested	and	tried	on	it.
You’re	not	really	going	to	grow	in	faith	if	you	don’t	make	a	commitment.	Yet,
faith	is	a	pure	gift	from	God	so	that	you	can	make	such	a	commitment	in	the	first
place.	The	two	are	strangely	interrelated.	As	you	stand	on	your	commitment
throughout	testings	I’m	convinced	that	God	gives	you	more	and	more	faith	as
you	go	along.	Your	faith	grows	and	is	strengthened.	Faith	is	really	saying	“I

you	go	along.	Your	faith	grows	and	is	strengthened.	Faith	is	really	saying	“I
have	made	this	commitment,	I	have	entered	into	this	contract,	and	I’m	going	to
stand	by	it.”
You	cannot	permit	Satan’s	doubts	to	dwell	in	your	mind	regarding	your
commitment.	You	must	throw	out	any	doubts	immediately.	As	you	are	being
tested	and	tried,	you	need	to	understand	that	everything	that	happens	here	in	the
physical	world	has	an	effect	in	the	spirit	world.	For	every	time	Satan	says	“I
petition	for	this	girl’s	parents”	for	example,	and	Father	says	“Alright,	go	ahead
and	take	them.”	(this	means	bringing	about	their	physical	death,	Satan	cannot
touch	their	souls)	and	I	still	serve	the	Lord,	then	there	is	a	victory	won	in	the
spiritual	world	which	drives	back	the	spiritual	forces	of	darkness	so	that	more
souls	can	come	to	Jesus	Christ.	There	is	always	an	effect	on	the	spirit	world.	We
have	no	idea	what	happened	in	the	spiritual	world	because	of	Satan’s	defeat	in
the	case	of	Job.
Job	had	everything	wiped	out	at	once.	Satan	does	not	usually	work	in	that
manner.	When	everything	is	taken	away	in	one	day’s	time	it	is	clearly	a
supernatural	act.	Satan	doesn’t	usually	work	that	way	in	our	lives.	He	takes	one
thing	here,	one	loved	one	there,	you	just	begin	to	get	recovered	from	the	grief	of
it	and	then	he	takes	another	one.	He	is	a	master	at	causing	agony.
As	you	stand	firm,	no	matter	what	the	circumstances	and	continue	to	serve	God,
understand	that	this	is	a	part	of	the	literal	physical	dying	brought	about	as	a
result	of	daily	carrying	your	cross	and	being	a	hated	alien	in	this	world.	We	are
living	a	literal	living	death	from	the	moment	we	accept	Jesus	Christ	because	our
life	is	now	established	in	the	spiritual	realm	and	we	have	eternal	life	through	our
soul	and	our	spiritual	bodies.	But	this	physical	existence	is	now	all	dying	to	us.
That’s	why	the	instant	you	become	saved	you’re	in	warfare	against	Satan.	There
is	no	other	choice.
“	...	as	dying,	and,	behold,	we	live...	”
II	Corinthians	6:9
People	will	say,	“You’re	really	coming	across	hard.”	God	says	in	Isaiah:
“For	my	thoughts	are	not	your	thoughts,	neither
are	your	ways	my	ways,	saith	the	Lord.	For	as
the	heavens	are	higher	than	the	earth,	so	are	my
ways	higher	than	your	ways,	and	my	thoughts
than	your	thoughts.”

than	your	thoughts.”
Isaiah	55:8-9
The	plain	fact	is	GOD	IS	GOD.	We	cannot	question	Him.
“Many	therefore	of	his	disciples,	when	they	had	heard	this	said,	This	is
an	hard	saying;	who	can	hear	it?	...	From	that	time	many	of	his	disciples
went	back,	and	walked	no	more	with	him.”	John	6:60	&	66
What	happened	to	Job?	After	all	of	this	had	occurred	to	him,	what	happened	to
him?	You	see,	through	all	of	this	Job	had	an	opportunity	to	catch	a	glimpse	of
God,	and	immediately	when	he	did,	NOTHING	ELSE	MATTERED.	Once	Job
caught	a	glimpse	of	God	he	did	not	care	anything	at	all	about	everything	that	had
happened	to	him.	In	the	book	of	Revelation	where	it	says	that	Father	is	going	to
wipe	away	every	tear	from	our	eyes,	I	know,	from	personal	experience,	that
when	we	get	one	glimpse	of	God	himself	absolutely	nothing	else	will	matter.	It
is	an	incredible	thing.	God	himself	is	vastly	wonderful	and	great	beyond
anything	we	can	imagine.	God	is	pure	power,	pure	love,	pure	justice,	pure
holiness,	pure	greatness,	pure	beauty.	With	one	glimpse	of	Him	our
relationships,	everything	we	might	have	or	hold	dear	fades	into	insignificance.
Nothing	pertaining	to	us	matters	to	us	once	we	glimpse	God.
“Then	Job	answered	the	Lord	and	said,	‘I	know	that	thou	canst	do	every
thing,	and	that	no	thought	can	be	withholden	from	thee.	Who	is	he	that
hideth	counsel	without	knowledge?	Therefore	have	I	uttered	that	I
understood	not;	things	too	wonderful	for	me,	which	I	knew	not.	Hear,	I
beseech	thee,	and	I	will	speak:	I	will	demand	of	thee,	and	declare	thou
unto	me.	I	have	heard	of	thee	by	the	hearing	of	the	ear:	but	now	mine	eye
seeth	thee.	Wherefore	I	abhor	myself,	and	repent	in	dust	and	ashes.’”	Job
42:1-6
Note	here	where	Job	says	“I	have	heard	of	thee	by	the	hearing	of	the	ear:
but	now	mine	eye	seeth	thee.	Wherefore	I	abhor	myself,	and	repent	in
dust	and	ashes.”	(vs.	5-6)	Job	didn’t	have	anything	to	repent	for.	The
earlier	part	of	the	book	makes	it	very	plain	that	in	everything	Job	did	not
sin.
“In	all	this	Job	sinned	not,	nor	charged	God	foolishly.”	Job	1:22
“...	In	all	this	did	not	Job	sin	with	his	lips.”	Job	2:10
But	the	instant	Job	got	a	glimpse	of	God	as	He	really	is,	nothing	else
mattered.	It	just	didn’t	matter.

mattered.	It	just	didn’t	matter.
My	prayer	is	that	the	Lord	will	reveal	Himself	as	only	HE	can	do,	both	to
myself	and	to	everyone	reading	this	book.	We	could	not	possibly	receive
a	greater	blessing.	The	Lord	calls	many	people	into	many	different	types
of	service,	but	all	of	us	will,	one	day,	be	attacked	viciously	by	Satan.
When	that	day	comes	we	must	be	prepared	to	stand	up	and	fight.	If	we
do,	and	if	we	endure	to	the	end,	Jesus	will	give	us	that	crown	of	life	and
we	will	have	the	indescribable	blessing	of	seeing	God	just	as	He	is	in	all
of	His	glory.
“And	I	heard	a	great	voice	out	of	heaven	saying,	Behold,	the
tabernacle	of	God	is	with	men,	and	he	will	dwell	with	them,	and
they	shall	be	his	people,	and	God	himself	shall	be	with	them,	and
be	their	God.	And	God	shall	wipe	away	all	tears	from	their	eyes;
and	there	shall	be	no	more	death,	neither	sorrow,	nor	crying,
neither	shall	there	be	any	more	pain:	for	the	former	things	are
passed	away.”	Revelation	21:3-4

CHAPTER	16
How	To	Fight

REBECCA	TALKS:
God	called	us	to	be	soldiers	not	pacifists.	No	where	does	the	Bible	give	room	for
“soft”	Christians.	As	discussed	in	the	previous	chapter	we	are	to	be	fighters	and
soldiers,	and	that,	primarily,	in	the	spirit	world.	We	are	living	in	a	world	ruled	by
Satan	and	time	is	running	out.	Satan	is	becoming	bolder	and	bolder.
“For	we	wrestle	not	against	flesh	and	blood,	but	against	principalities,
against	powers,	against	the	rulers	of	the	darkness	of	this	world,	against
spiritual	wickedness	in	high	places.”	Ephesians	6:12
“For	though	we	walk	in	the	flesh,	we	do	not	war	after	the	flesh:	For	the
weapons	of	our	warfare	are	not	carnal,	but	mighty	through	God	to	the
pulling	down	of	strong	holds.”	II	Corinthians	10:3-4
“Thou	therefore	endure	hardness,	as	a	good	soldier	of	Jesus	Christ.	No
man	that	warreth	entangleth	himself	with	the	affairs	of	this	life;	that	he
may	please	him	who	hath	chosen	him	to	be	a	soldier.”	II	Timothy	2:3-4
“Cursed	be	he	that	doeth	the	work	of	the	Lord	deceitfully,	and	cursed	be
he	that	keepeth	back	his	sword	from	blood.”	Jeremiah	48:10
As	we	take	up	the	power	and	authority	Jesus	has	given	us	in	His	name	and	take
the	offensive	in	warfare	against	Satan,	the	persecution	that	inevitably	will	come
will	not	come	in	the	way	we	think.	People	will	not	stand	up	and	say,	“We	are
slandering	you	because	of	your	stand	for	Jesus.”	No,	you	will	be	accused	of
doing	all	sorts	of	wrong	things	that	you	did	not	do,	of	being	too	radical	and	of
becoming	unbalanced	in	your	mind.	Schizophrenia	and	paranoia	are	favorite
accusations	of	Satan’s.	You	will	be	discredited	by	your	fellow	Christians	more
than	by	avowed	non-Christians.	Satan	always	deceives	and	lies,	nothing	is	ever
as	it	seems.	His	most	effective	servants	are	those	who	are	supposedly	the
strongest	Christians,	the	regular	church	goers,	the	financially	successful	and
respected	and	revered	members	of	your	community.	They	are	the	ones	who	will
accuse	and	persecute	those	fighting	in	spiritual	warfare	for	Christ.	But	fight	we
must	if	souls	are	to	be	saved	and	brought	to	Jesus.
“Blessed	are	they	which	are	persecuted	for
righteousness’	sake:	for	theirs	is	the	kingdom	of
heaven.	Blessed	are	ye,	when	men	shall	revile

heaven.	Blessed	are	ye,	when	men	shall	revile
you,	and	persecute	you,	and	shall	say	all	manner
of	evil	against	you	falsely,	for	my	sake.	Rejoice,
and	be	exceeding	glad:	for	great	is	your	reward
in	heaven:	for	so	persecuted	they	the	prophets
which	were	before	you.”
Matthew	5:10-12
Do	not	be	surprised	when	the	persecution	comes	from	within	your	own	church,
from	those	who	you	thought	were	our	Christian	brothers	and	sisters	and	from
your	family.	The	scriptures	are	plain:
“For	I	know	this,	that	after	my	departing	shall
grievous	wolves	enter	in	among	you,	not	sparing
the	flock.	Also	of	your	own	selves	shall	men
arise,	speaking	perverse	things,	to	draw	away
disciples	after	them.”
Acts	20:29-30
“For	such	are	false	apostles,	deceitful	workers,
transforming	themselves	into	the	apostles	of
Christ.	And	no	marvel;	for	Satan	himself	is
transformed	into	an	angel	of	light.	Therefore	it
is	no	great	thing	if	his	ministers	also	be
transformed	as	the	ministers	of	righteousness;
whose	end	shall	be	according	to	their	works.”
II	Corinthians	11:13-15
There	is	one	point	that	we	both	wish	to	make	clear.	We	are	not	trying	to	dictate
to	you,	nor	control	you	in	any	way.
We	are	simply	sharing	with	you	what	the	Lord	has	taught	us.	You	must
ultimately	get	your	guidance	directly	from	the	Lord.	You	must	learn	to	hear	the
Lord	in	your	spirit	and	mind.	Only	the	Holy	Spirit	can	teach	you	this,	but	you
must	ask	for	it	and	seek	such	communication	earnestly.	In	fact,	you	must	realize
that	you	are	responsible	as	an	individual	before	the	Lord	to	carefully	study
everything	anyone	tells	you,	to	see	if	it	is	consistent	with	the	scriptures.	That

includes	this	book	as	well	as	anything	your	pastor	says.	Paul	himself	instructed
the	Corinthians	to	do	this:
“Let	the	prophets	speak	two	or	three,	and	let	the
other	judge.”	[Carefully	weigh,	evaluate,	etc.]
I	Corinthians	14:29
The	reader	would	do	well	to	read	this	whole	chapter	as	it	contains	much
neglected	and	overlooked	commands	applying	to	our	church	services	of	today.
Anyone	involved	in	spiritual	warfare	must	be	prepared	to	fight	in	more	than	one
area.	But	please	remember,	you	do	not	control	how	or	where	you	fight.	Only	the
Lord	controls	that.	We	simply	make	ourselves	available	to	Him	to	use	as	He
chooses.	He	is	our	commanding	officer.	Our	goals	are	always	to	do	the	will	of
Jesus	Christ,	to	bring	glory	to	His	name	and	to	bring	others	to	a	saving
knowledge	of	Jesus.	Remember	always,	Jesus	Is	God!	Anyone	who	would	say
He	is	anything	less	is	false.
Be	careful	who	you	confide	in,	be	wise,	be	alert	to	the	Lord’s	guidance	always.
Our	Lord	warned	us:	“Lay	hands	suddenly	on	no	man	...”	I	Timothy	5:22
Wait	to	see	the	fruits	of	a	person’s	life;	wait	until	the	Lord	gives	you	a	complete
peace	with	them.
“Beloved,	believe	not	every	spirit,	but	try	the	spirits	whether	they	are	of
God:	because	many	false	prophets	are	gone	out	into	the	world.”	I	John
4:1
Remember,	Satan	and	his	demons	will	always	try	to	deceive	you.	Especially	in
spiritual	matters.
There	are	at	least	8	steps	that	should	be	taken	by	anyone	seriously	entering
spiritual	warfare.	They	are	as	follows.
#1)	You	must	accept	total	mastership	of	Jesus	in	every	area	of	your	life.
#2)	You	must	be	willing	for	a	total	dealing	of	the	cross	in	your	life.	This	must	be
an	on-going	day-by-day	experience.	There	is	a	book	by	Dr.	A.W.	Tozer	called
The	Pursuit	Of	God,	which	I	think	every	Christian	should	read.	The	following

quote	explains	this	dealing	of	the	cross	in	your	life	better	than	I	could.
“Everything	in	the	New	Testament	accords	with	this	Old	Testament
picture.	Ransomed	men	need	no	longer	pause	in	fear	to	enter	the	Holy	of
Holies.	God	wills	that	we	should	push	on	into	His	presence	and	live	our
whole	life	there.	This	is	to	be	known	to	us	in	conscious	experience.	It	is
more	than	a	doctrine	to	be	held;	it	is	a	life	to	be	enjoyed	every	moment	of
every	day...
“Similarly,	the	presence	of	God	is	the	central	fact	of	Christianity.	At	the
heart	of	the	Christian	message	is	God	Himself	waiting	for	His	redeemed
children	to	push	into	conscious	awareness	of	His	presence.	That	type	of
Christianity	which	happens	now	to	be	in	the	vogue	knows	this	Presence
only	in	theory.	It	fails	to	stress	the	Christian’s	privilege	of	present
realization.	According	to	its	teachings	we	are	in	the	presence	of	God
positionally,	and	nothing	is	said	about	the	need	to	experience	that
Presence	actually	...	What	hinders	us?	”The	answer	usually	given,	simply
that	we	are	‘cold,’	will	not	explain	all	the	facts.	There	is	something	more
serious	than	coldness	of	heart	...	What	is	it?	What	but	the	presence	of	a
veil	in	our	hearts?	A	veil	not	taken	away	as	the	first	veil	was,	but	which
remains	there	still	shutting	out	the	light	and	hiding	the	face	of	God	from
us.
“Self	is	the	opaque	veil	that	hides	the	face	of	God	from	us.	It	can	be
removed	only	in	spiritual	experience,	never	by	mere	instruction.	We	may
as	well	try	to	instruct	leprosy	out	of	our	system.	There	must	be	a	work	of
God	in	destruction	before	we	are	free.	We	must	invite	the	cross	to	do	its
deadly	work	within	us.	We	must	bring	our	self-sins	to	the	cross	for
judgment.	We	must	prepare	ourselves	for	an	ordeal	of	suffering	in	some
measure	like	that	through	which	our	Savior	passed	when	He	suffered
under	Pontius	Pilate.	”Let	us	remember	that	when	we	talk	of	the	rending
of	the	veil	we	are	speaking	in	a	figure,	and	the	thought	of	it	is	poetical,
almost	pleasant,	but	in	actuality	there	is	nothing	pleasant	about	it.	In
human	experience	that	veil	is	made	of	living	spiritual	tissue;	it	is
composed	of	the	sentinent,	quivering	stuff	of	which	our	whole	beings
consist,	and	to	touch	it	is	to	touch	us	where	we	feel	pain.	To	tear	it	away
is	to	injure	us,	to	hurt	us	and	make	us	bleed.	To	say	otherwise	is	to	make
the	cross	no	cross	and	death	no	death	at	all.	It	is	never	fun	to	die.	To	rip
through	the	dear	and	tender	stuff	of	which	life	is	made	can	never	be
anything	but	deeply	painful.	Yet	that	is	what	the	cross	did	to	Jesus	and	it
is	what	the	cross	would	do	to	every	man	to	set	him	free.	“Let	us	beware

is	what	the	cross	would	do	to	every	man	to	set	him	free.	“Let	us	beware
of	tinkering	with	our	inner	life,	hoping	ourselves	to	rend	the	veil.	God
must	do	everything	for	us.	Our	part	is	to	yield	and	trust.	We	must
confess,	forsake,	repudiate	the	self-life,	and	then	reckon	it	crucified.	But
we	must	be	careful	to	distinguish	lazy	‘acceptance’	from	the	real	work	of
God.	We	must	insist	upon	the	work	being	done.	We	dare	not	rest	content
with	a	neat	doctrine	of	self-crucifixion.	That	is	to	imitate	Saul	and	spare
the	best	of	the	sheep	and	oxen.	”Insist	that	the	work	be	done	in	very	truth
and	it	will	be	done.	The	cross	is	rough	and	it	is	deadly,	but	it	is	effective.
It	does	not	keep	its	victim	hanging	there	forever.	There	comes	a	moment
when	its	work	is	finished	and	the	suffering	victim	dies.	After	that	is
resurrection	glory	and	power,	and	the	pain	is	forgotten	for	joy	that	the
veil	is	taken	away	and	we	have	entered	in	actual	spiritual	experience	the
presence	of	the	living	God.”	pp.	46	&	47
#3)	A	willingness	to	lay	down	both	your	own	life	and	the	lives	of	your	loved
ones	if	the	Lord	so	chooses.	You	can	probably	expect	a	total	change	in	your	life
situation.
“He	that	loveth	father	or	mother	more	than	me
is	not	worthy	of	me:	and	he	that	loveth	son	or
daughter	more	than	me	is	not	worthy	of	me.
And	he	that	taketh	not	his	cross,	and	followeth
after	me,	is	not	worthy	of	me.”	Matthew	10:3738	“	...	he	that	loseth	his	life	for	my	sake	shall
find	it.”
Matthew	10:39
#4)	You	must	learn	to	hear	the	Lord	speak	to	you	in	your	spirit.	By	“hearing	the
Lord	speak	to	you	in	your	spirit,”	I	do	not	mean	an	audible	voice	which	you	hear
with	your	physical	ears.	What	I	mean	is,	the	Lord	says	something	to	your	spirit
and	then	suddenly	it	is	flashed	into	your	mind	in	the	form	of	a	thought.	That	is
one	reason	why	it	is	so	important	to	scrutinize	our	thoughts	and	ask	the	Lord	to
keep	our	minds	and	hearts	pure.
“I	[Jesus]	have	yet	many	things	to	say	unto	you,	but	ye	cannot	bear	them
now.	Howbeit	when	he,	the	Spirit	of	truth,	is	come,	he	will	guide	you
into	all	truth:	for	he	shall	not	speak	of	himself;	but	whatsoever	he	shall
hear,	that	shall	he	speak	:	and	he	will	shew	you	things	to	come.	He	shall

glorify	me:	for	he	shall	receive	of	mine,	and	shall	shew	it	unto	you.”	John
16:12-14	“Whereof	the	Holy	Ghost	also	is	a	witness	to	us:	for	after	that
he	had	said	before,	This	is	the	covenant	that	I	will	make	with	them	after
those	days,	saith	the	Lord,	I	will	put	my	laws	into	their	hearts,	and	in
their	minds	will	I	write	them;”	Hebrews	10:15-16
The	Holy	Spirit	will	put	thoughts	into	our	minds,	that	is	how	He	speaks	to	us	and
is	a	witness	to	us.	Satan	can	also	flash	thoughts	into	our	minds,	but	remember,
the	Holy	Spirit	will	confirm	to	your	heart	and	spirit	what	is	from	Satan,	and	what
is	not.	The	Bible	is	our	safeguard	here.	The	Lord	will	never	tell	you	anything
that	is	not	consistent	with	His	word,	the	Bible.	Also,	if	you	are	praying	and
talking	with	the	Lord	silently,	Satan	cannot	read	your	mind	and	thus	will	not	be
able	to	put	in	thoughts	that	are	in	context	with	what	is	currently	going	on	in	your
mind	as	you	pray.	This	is	another	important	reason	why	you	must	learn	to
control	your	mind	so	that	it	does	not	wander	while	you	are	in	prayer	and
communion	with	the	Lord.
“I	love	them	that	love	me;	and	those	that	seek	me	early	shall	find	me.”
Proverbs	8:17
The	literal	translation	of	the	Hebrew	word	for	“early”	means	“diligently,	with
the	implication	of	earnestness”	according	to	Strong’s	Exhaustive	Concordance
of	the	Bible.	You	must	seek	such	a	relationship	with	the	Lord	diligently.
Only	the	Holy	Spirit	can	teach	you	to	hear	His	voice.	You	may	have	to	seek	this
type	of	relationship	with	much	fasting,	tears	and	prayer.	Remember,	the	Lord
never	does	anything	in	a	hurry	and	He	will	probably	test	you	to	see	how	sincere
you	are.	If	you	have	not	asked	the	Lord	to	do	the	work	of	a	total	dealing	of	the
cross	in	you	as	described	in	the	quote	from	Tozer,	you	will	not	be	able	to
develop	such	a	relationship	with	Him.	Also	if	you	are	not	totally	committed	to
Him	you	will	not	be	able	to	develop	such	a	relationship.
When	the	Lord	does	speak	to	you	and	you	have	checked	to	see	that	what	was
said	is	consistent	with	the	Bible,	and	the	Holy	Spirit	confirms	to	your	heart	that
you	did	indeed	hear	His	voice,	then	you	must	stand	in	faith	that	this	is	so.
Otherwise	Satan	will	try	to	persuade	you	that	you	did	not	really	hear	from	the
Lord,	that	you	were	only	imagining	things.
“The	Spirit	itself	beareth	witness	with	our	spirit,	that	we	are	the	children
of	God:”	Romans	8:16	“Wherefore	as	the	Holy	Ghost	saith,	To	day	if	ye
will	hear	his	voice,	Harden	not	your	hearts,	as	in	the	provocation,	in	the
day	of	temptation	in	the	wilderness:”	Hebrews	3:8-9

The	Holy	Spirit	will	speak	to	us	if	we	will	hear	His	voice.	Then	when	we	do,	we
must	not	harden	our	hearts,	but	step	out	in	faith	and	obedience	in	accordance
with	what	the	Holy	Spirit	said	to	us.	Usually	the	Holy	Spirit	starts	speaking	to	a
believer	by	bringing	to	his	or	her	attention	something	that	is	not	pleasing	to	the
Lord.	The	temptation	is	to	ignore	this	communication	and	continue	doing
whatever	it	is	the	Lord	is	not	pleased	with.	If	you	do	this	you	are	“hardening
your	heart”	and	will	stop	further	communication	from	the	Lord.
The	Holy	Spirit	will	bear	witness	with	your	spirit	that	what	you	have	heard	is
from	Him.	If	what	you	hear	is	not	from	Him	learn	to	be	sensitive	to	the
hesitation	or	check	you	will	feel.	Too	often	we	are	anxious	to	go	ahead	and	do
something	and	pay	no	heed	to	these	checks.	We	must	learn	to	be	patient	and	wait
for	confirmation	before	taking	any	action.	Impulsiveness	cannot	have	any	part	in
spiritual	warfare.
#5)	You	must	learn	absolute	mind	control.	This	will	probably	be	one	of	the
hardest	things	you	will	ever	do.	The	Lord’s	command	is	clear:
“For	though	we	walk	in	the	flesh,	we	do	not	war
after	the	flesh:	(For	the	weapons	of	our	warfare
are	not	carnal,	but	mighty	through	God	to	the
pulling	down	of	strong	holds;)	Casting	down
imaginations,	and	every	high	thing	that	exalteth
itself	against	the	knowledge	of	God,	and
bringing	into	captivity	every	thought	to	the
obedience	of	Christ.”	II	Corinthians	10:5	“And
be	not	conformed	to	this	world:	but	be	ye
transformed	by	the	renewing	of	your	mind	...	”
Romans	12:2
The	mind	is	a	major	battlefield,	Satan	attacks	everyone	in	their	mind	more	than
any	other	way.	This	battle	is	unceasing,	unrelenting	and	will	continue	as	long	as
we	live	here	on	the	earth.	No	longer	can	you	lazily	allow	thoughts	to	run	through
your	mind	willy-nilly.	We	are	responsible	before	God	to	stop	and	scrutinize
every	thought	that	goes	through	our	minds	to	decide	if	it	is	obedient	to	Christ.
Let’s	face	it,	basically	we	are	lazy	creatures.	I	can	tell	you	that	when	God	first
began	bringing	this	to	my	attention	it	was	one	of	the	most	difficult	things	He

began	bringing	this	to	my	attention	it	was	one	of	the	most	difficult	things	He
ever	asked	me	to	do.	To	get	through	medical	school,	I	had	to	study	for	hours	on
end.	I	knew	how	to	maintain	absolute	concentration	on	something,	but	I	still	did
not	control	my	thought	life.
Everyone	has	a	continual	“thought-life”	going	on	in	his	or	her	mind,	that	is	the
way	we	are	created.	We	are	responsible	to	bring	every	one	of	those	thoughts
captive	to	Jesus	Christ.
You	must	understand	that	Satan	can	inject	thoughts	into	your	mind	just	the	same
as	a	doctor	can	inject	medicine	into	your	body.	Satan	and	his	demons	can	do	this
from	outside	your	body.	They	do	not	have	to	be	inside	you	to	do	it.	However,
they	cannot	read	your	mind.	Only	God	can	know	your	thoughts	and	intentions.
(See	Hebrews	4:12-13	and	Jeremiah	17:9-10.)	Therefore,	as	in	the	example	Jesus
set	for	us	when	He	was	here	on	earth	in	human	form,	we	must	rebuke	Satan	and
his	demons	out	loud.
Satan	will	put	thoughts	into	your	mind	starting	with	the	word	“I”	to	make	you
think	the	thought	was	originated	by	you.	For	instance,	a	thought	may	come	such
as	“I	sure	would	like	to	do	____,”	something	which	you	know	is	sin.	As	soon	as
you	realize	such	a	thought	is	in	your	mind,	you	need	to	attack	the	real	source.
Out	loud	say	something	like	this:	“Satan	and	you	demons,	I	rebuke	you	in	the
name	of	Jesus	Christ.	I	will	not	accept	that	thought.	Go	away!”	Then	force
yourself	to	think	about	scripture,	recite	a	passage	out	loud	if	necessary	to	control
your	mind.
“Finally,	brethren,	whatsoever	things	are	true,
whatsoever	things	are	honest,	whatsoever	things
are	just,	whatsoever	things	are	pure,	whatsoever
things	are	lovely,	whatsoever	things	are	of	good
report;	if	there	be	any	virtue,	and	if	there	be	any
praise,	think	on	these	things.”	Philippians	4:8
This	is	another	example	of	controlling	our	minds.	We	must	literally	re-train	and
renew	our	minds	as	in	Romans:
“And	be	not	conformed	to	this	world:	but	be	ye	transformed	by	the
renewing	of	your	mind,	that	ye	may	prove	what	is	that	good,	and
acceptable,	and	perfect,	will	of	God.”	Romans	12:2
This	takes	time	and	persistence,	and	hard	work!
“Put	on	therefore,	as	the	elect	of	God,	holy	and	beloved,	bowels	of

“Put	on	therefore,	as	the	elect	of	God,	holy	and	beloved,	bowels	of
mercies,	kindness,	humbleness	of	mind,	meekness,	longsuffering;”
Colossians	3:12
Did	you	ever	wonder	how	you	would	go	about	“putting	on”	such	things	as
kindness,	mercy,	etc?	I	did,	many	many	times.	Finally	the	Lord	gave	me	the
answer.	We	must	train	our	minds	before-hand	so	that	when	situations	arise	in
which	people	do	us	harm,	we	will	not	just	react	in	our	natural	emotions	of	the
moment.	We	will	choose	to	act	with	God’s	mercy	and	return	good	for	evil.
The	well	known	Chinese	Christian	author	Watchman	Nee	describes	the	battle	for
the	mind	as	follows:	(Please	note,	his	works	have	all	been	translated	from
Chinese	and	therefore	might	be	a	little	difficult	to	read.)
“According	to	the	Bible	the	mind	of	man	is	unusual	in	that	it	constitutes	a
battlefield	where	Satan	and	his	evil	spirits	contend	against	the	truth	and
hence	against	the	believer.	We	may	illustrate	as	follows.	Man’s	will	and
spirit	are	like	a	citadel	which	the	evil	spirits	crave	to	capture.	The	open
field	where	the	battle	is	waged	for	the	seizure	of	the	citadel	is	man’s
mind.	Note	how	Paul	the	Apostle	describes	it:	‘though	we	live	in	the
world	we	are	not	carrying	on	a	worldly	war,	for	the	weapons	of	our
warfare	are	not	worldly	but	have	divine	power	to	destroy	strongholds.
We	destroy	arguments	and	every	proud	obstacle	to	the	knowledge	of
God,	and	take	every	thought	captive	to	obey	Christ.’	(II	Cor.	10:3-5)	He
initially	tells	us	of	a	battle	—	then	where	the	battle	is	fought	—	and
finally	for	what	objective.	This	struggle	pertains	exclusively	to	man’s
mind.	The	Apostle	likens	man’s	arguments	of	reasonings	to	an	enemy’s
strongholds.	He	pictures	the	mind	as	held	by	the	enemy;	it	must	therefore
be	broken	into	by	waging	war.	He	concludes	that	many	rebellious
thoughts	are	housed	in	these	strongholds	and	need	to	be	taken	captive	to
the	obedience	of	Christ.	All	this	plainly	shows	us	that	the	mind	of	man	is
the	scene	of	battle	where	the	evil	spirits	clash	with	God	...	When	firmly
held	by	Satan	the	mind	of	man	becomes	‘hardened;’	man	follows	the
desires	of	body	and	mind	(as)	‘children	of	wrath’	and	so	‘is	estranged
and	hostile	in	mind’	because	‘the	mind	that	is	set	on	the	flesh	is	hostile	to
God.’	(II	Cor.	3:14;	Eph.	2:3;	Col	1:21;	Rom	8:7)
“Upon	reading	these	various	passages	we	can	see	clearly	how	the	powers
of	darkness	are	especially	related	to	man’s	mind,	how	it	is	peculiarly
susceptible	to	Satan’s	assault.	With	respect	to	man’s	will,	emotion	and
body,	the	powers	of	evil	are	helpless	to	do	anything	directly	unless	they

first	have	gained	some	ground	therein.	But	with	man’s	mind	they	can
work	freely	without	initially	persuading	man	or	securing	his	invitation.
The	mind	appears	to	be	their	possession	already.	The	Apostle	in
comparing	men’s	minds	to	an	enemy’s	strongholds	seems	to	imply	that
Satan	and	his	wicked	spirits	already	have	established	a	deep	relationship
with	the	minds	of	men,	that	somehow	they	are	using	them	as	their
bastions	in	which	to	imprison	their	captives.	Through	man’s	mind	they
impose	their	authority	and	through	the	mind	of	their	captives	they
transmit	poisonous	thoughts	to	others	so	that	these	too	may	rise	up
against	God.	It	is	difficult	to	estimate	how	much	of	the	world’s
philosophy,	ethics,	knowledge,	research	and	science	flow	from	the
powers	of	darkness.	But	of	one	point	we	are	certain:	all	arguments	and
proud	obstacles	against	the	knowledge	of	God	are	the	fortresses	of	the
enemy.	”Is	it	strange	to	behold	the	mind	in	such	close	proximity	to	the
authorities	of	wickedness?	Was	not	the	sin	which	mankind	first
committed	that	of	seeking	the	knowledge	of	good	and	evil,	and	that	at	the
instigation	of	Satan?	Hence	man’s	mind	is	especially	related	to	Satan.	If
we	were	to	peruse	the	Scriptures	carefully	and	to	observe	the	experiences
of	the	saints	we	would	discover	that	all	communications	between	human
and	satanic	forces	occur	in	the	organ	of	thought.	Take	for	instance,
Satan’s	temptation.	Every	temptation	with	which	he	entices	man	is
presented	to	his	mind.	It	is	true	that	Satan	often	uses	the	flesh	to	secure
the	consent	of	man,	yet	in	each	instance	of	enticement	the	enemy	creates
some	kind	of	temptation	and	thought.	All	temptations	are	offered	us	in
the	form	of	thoughts	...
“The	original	definition	of	repentance	is	none	else	than	‘a	change	of
mind.’	...	”But	even	following	repentance	the	believer’s	mind	is	not
liberated	totally	from	the	touch	of	Satan.	As	the	enemy	worked	through
the	mind	in	former	days,	so	today	will	he	work	in	the	same	manner.	Paul,
in	writing	to	the	Corinthian	believers,	confided	that	he	was	‘afraid	that	as
the	serpent	deceived	Eve	by	his	cunning,	your	thoughts	will	be	led	astray
from	a	sincere	and	pure	devotion	to	Christ.’	(II	Cor.	11:3)	The	Apostle
well	recognizes	that	as	the	god	of	this	world	blinds	the	mind	of
unbelievers	so	will	he	deceive	the	mind	of	the	believers	...	The	mind	is
the	easiest	avenue	for	them	to	accomplish	their	purpose.	Eve’s	heart	was
sinless	and	yet	she	received	Satan’s	suggested	thoughts.	She	was	thus
beguiled	through	his	deception	into	forfeiting	her	reasoning	and	tumbling
into	the	snare	of	the	enemy.	Let	a	believer	accordingly	be	careful	in	his
boast	of	possessing	an	honest	and	sincere	heart,	for	unless	he	learns	how

boast	of	possessing	an	honest	and	sincere	heart,	for	unless	he	learns	how
to	repulse	the	evil	spirits	in	his	mind	he	will	continue	to	be	tempted	and
deceived	into	losing	the	sovereignty	of	his	will.	pp.	7-10
“God	wishes	to	restore	our	thought	life	to	the	excellent	state	it	had	when
He	created	it	so	that	we	may	not	only	glorify	God	in	our	walk	but	may
glorify	Him	in	our	thinking	as	well.	Who	can	estimate	the	multiplied
number	of	God’s	children	who,	due	to	neglecting	their	mind,	grow
narrow,	stubborn	and	obstinate,	and	even	sometimes	defiled.	They	fall
short	of	the	glory	of	God.	The	Lord’s	people	need	to	know	that	if	they
want	to	live	a	full	life	their	mind	must	be	renewed.	So	whenever	a	child
of	God	notes	that	he	is	no	longer	able	to	govern	the	mind,	he	ought	to
perceive	at	once	that	it	is	the	enemy	who	is	managing	it	...	God’s
intention	is	for	man	to	control	himself.	Man	has	the	authority	to	regulate
his	every	natural	endowment,	hence	his	mental	processes	should	be
subject	to	the	power	of	his	will.	A	Christian	ought	to	inquire	of	himself:
Are	these	my	thoughts?	Is	it	I	who	am	thinking?	If	it	is	not	I	thinking,	it
must	then	be	the	evil	spirit	who	is	able	to	work	in	man’s	mind.	The
person	should	know	that	in	case	he	has	not	intended	to	think	and	yet
there	are	thoughts	arising	in	his	head,	he	must	conclude	that	these	are	not
of	him	but	of	the	evil	spirit.”	pp.	12-13	The	Spiritual	Man,	Volume	III,	by
Watchman	Nee.
Let	me	give	you	some	examples.
A.	There	are	3	sources	of	the	thoughts	that	come	into	the	mind	of	a	true	born
again	believer.	The	person	himself,	the	Holy	Spirit,	and,	Satan	and/or	his
demons.	Nearly	everywhere	we	go	to	speak	we	always	have	people	criticize	us
and	tell	us	that	we	must	not	speak	about	Satan	because	in	so	doing	we	are	giving
glory	to	him,	etc.,	etc.	Why?	Because	there	are	almost	always	some	witches	in
every	audience.	They	sit	back	and	with	a	simple	incantation	send	a	demon	to
every	person	in	the	audience	(please	note,	the	demons	do	not	go	into	the	people).
The	demon	shoots	in	the	thought	that	“These	women	should	not	talk	about	Satan
because	in	so	doing	they	are	giving	glory	to	Satan.”	The	person	assumes	the
thought	is	their	own	and	therefore	must	be	true.
B.	The	roommate	I	lived	with	at	the	time	I	met	Elaine	was	not	a	Christian,	and
frankly	I	did	not	like	her	at	all.	I	had	reluctantly	agreed	to	let	her	stay	with	me
for	the	school	year	hoping	to	bring	her	to	the	Lord	but	I	had	a	most	difficult	year.
Our	personalities	were	very	different,	and	she	irritated	me	most	of	the	time.
During	this	time	the	Lord	was	teaching	me	to	control	my	mind.	One	of	the	first

things	the	Holy	Spirit	showed	me	was	that	most	mornings	as	I	was	preparing	to
go	into	work,	I	had	not	even	seen	Sue	yet,	but	in	my	mind	I	was	going	around
and	around	with	her	having	a	fight	in	my	mind	so	that	by	the	time	I	did	see	her	I
was	so	mad	at	her	I	couldn’t	even	say	a	civil	“Good	morning.”	Now	where	did
those	thoughts	come	from?	Not	from	me.	I	had	such	a	struggle	to	control	them,
there	were	times	when	I	would	say	to	myself,	“Rebecca,	shut-up!”	But	this
wouldn’t	do	any	good,	the	angry	thoughts	would	just	keep	on	going.	Why?
Because	by	telling	myself	to	shut-up	I	was	resisting	Satan	with	my	own	strength.
When	we	try	to	withstand	Satan	with	our	own	strength	we	lose	the	battle	before
we	even	get	started.
But	as	the	Holy	Spirit	taught	me	and	trained	me	to	recognize	that	those	thoughts
were	from	outside	of	me	and	from
Satan,	I	began	to	have	victory	as	I	rebuked	Satan	out	loud	in	the	name	of	Jesus.
Soon	I	learned	that	the	instant	that	first	negative	or	angry	thought	would	come
into	my	mind	about	Sue,	I	immediately	out	loud	said,	“Satan	and	you	demons	I
rebuke	you	in	the	name	of	Jesus!	I	will	not	accept	those	thoughts	about	Sue,”
and	would	force	myself	to	think	about	some	portion	of	scripture	and	recite	it	out
loud.	Then	I	had	victory	because	I	was	then	resisting	Satan	with	the	power	of
Jesus,	and	my	whole	relationship	with	her	improved	immensely.	How	many
marriages	and	families	and	churches	and	whole	communities	have	been
destroyed	by	this	one	simple	tactic?	(See	Figures	I,	II	and	III.)
#6)	Scripture	memory	is	another	important	point.
“Wherewithal	shall	a	young	man	cleanse	his	way?	By	taking	heed	thereto
according	to	thy	word	...	Thy	word	have	I	hid	in	mine	heart,	that	I	might
not	sin	against	thee.”	Psalm	119:	9	&	11
The	way	to	hide	God’s	word	in	your	heart	is	to	memorize	it.	I	cannot	emphasize
this	strongly	enough.	Believe	me,	when	you	are	fighting	with	demons,	you	do
not	have	time	to	go	thumbing	through	your	Bible.	You	may	well	lose	your	life	or
the	life	of	the	one	you	are	trying	to	deliver	if	you	have	to	take	the	time	to	even
open	your	Bible.
There	is	an	easy	way	to	memorize	scripture.	Set	aside	a	certain	time	each	day.
For	me,	it	is	the	20	minutes	or	so	I	spend	each	morning	blow-drying	my	hair.
Write	the	section	you	want	to	memorize	on	a	3	X	5	card.	I	have	my	cards	taped
on	my	mirror.	Write	the	section	of	scripture	you	want	to	memorize	with	the
reference	both	before	and	after	the	verses.	Usually	it	is	best	if	you	limit	it	to	no

more	than	2-3	verses.	Then,	out	loud	say	the	verses	and	reference	over	and	over
until	you	can	say	it	through	once	or	twice	perfectly	with	your	eyes	closed.	For
example:
“John	3:16	-	For	God	so	loved	the	world,	that	he	gave	his	only	begotten
Son,	that	whosoever	believeth	in	him	should	not	perish,	but	have
everlasting	life.	—	John	3:16”

Figure	I

Figure	II

Figure	III

Do	this	once	each	day.	Add	a	new	section	of	scripture	once	per	week.	If	you	do
this	faithfully	each	day	for	3	months	you	will	have	that	scripture	locked	into
your	memory	forever.	You	will	soon	find	that	the	Holy	Spirit	will	bring	these
verses	back	to	your	mind	many	times	per	day.	You	will	find	this	a	quick,	easy,
painless	way	to	memorize	scripture.
#7)	Authority.	God	always	puts	his	people	under	authority.	This	is	a	lesson	we
must	learn	early	if	we	are	to	survive	in	spiritual	warfare.	Unless	we	learn	to	obey
delegated	authority	we	will	never	truly	obey	God’s	direct	authority	and	thus	we
will	lose	many	battles	because	we	will	neither	hear	or	obey	our	captain,	Jesus

Christ.	I	think	it	would	be	wise	here	to	quote	a	section	from	the	book	Spiritual
Authority,	by	Watchman	Nee	(Christian	Fellowship	Publishers,	Inc.,	1972).
“God’s	children	should	not	only	learn	to	recognize	authority,	they	should
likewise	be	looking	for	those	to	whom	they	ought	to	be	obedient.	The
centurion	spoke	to	the	Lord	Jesus	saying:	‘I	also	am	a	man	under
authority,	having	under	myself	soldiers.’	(Matt.	8:9)
He	was	truly	a	man	who	knew	authority.	Today,	even	as	God	upholds	the
whole	universe	with	His	authority,	so	He	joins	His	children	together
through	His	authority.	If	any	one	of	His	children	is	independent	and	selfreliant,	not	subject	to	God’s	delegated	authority,	then	that	one	can	never
accomplish	the	work	of	God	on	earth.	Each	and	every	child	of	God	must
look	for	some	authority	to	obey	so	that	he	or	she	may	be	well	coordinated
with	others.	Sad	to	say,	though,	many	have	failed	this	point.”	page	115.
If	you	are	unable	to	come	under	the	authority	of	a	boss	at	your	work,	how,	then,
can	you	ever	really	come	under	God’s	authority?	Also,	be	very	careful	who’s
authority	you	place	yourself	under.	Do	not	be	in	a	hurry	to	become	a	member	of
a	particular	church	until	you	know	without	a	doubt	that	that	is	where	the	Lord
wants	you.	Once	you	place	yourself	under	such	authority	God	considers	it	very
serious	if	you	then	disobey	that	authority.	If	you	are	disobedient	to	such
authority	you	are	then	giving	Satan	legal	ground	in	your	life.
The	same	holds	true	for	women.	So	many	young	women	feel	that	they	cannot
survive	without	getting	married,	therefore	they	tend	to	marry	any	man	who
shows	an	interest	in	them.	I	have	seen	so	many	tragedies	of	young	women
earnestly	desiring	to	serve	the	Lord	who	are	tied	in	a	marriage	with	a	husband
who	is	not	interested	in	serving	the	Lord.	However,	because	they	have
committed	themselves	to	the	marriage	relationship,	God	will	not	honor	any
rebellion	by	them	against	their	husbands.	They	will	never	be	free	to	serve	the
Lord	in	the	way	they	would	have	been	had	they	not	married	the	man.
If	the	time	comes	when	you	must	obey	God’s	authority	rather	than	the
governmental	authority	you	have	been	placed	under	you	must	do	so,	but	openly
and	willing	to	take	the	punishment	coming.	For	example,	Daniel	refused	to	obey
the	decree	by	King	Darius	which	forbid	anyone	to	pray	to	God	for	a	period	of	30
days,	but	he	did	not	do	so	in	secret.
“Now	when	Daniel	knew	that	the	writing	was	signed,	he	went	into	his
house;	and	his	windows	being	open	in	his	chamber	toward	Jerusalem,	he
kneeled	upon	his	knees	three	times	a	day,	and	prayed,	and	gave	thanks
before	his	God,	as	he	did	afore	time.”	Daniel	6:10.

before	his	God,	as	he	did	afore	time.”	Daniel	6:10.
Daniel	obeyed	God	before	the	government,	but	he	did	so	openly,	willing	to	take
the	punishment.	God	honored	Daniel	in	this	and	saved	him	from	the	lions	in	the
den	into	which	he	was	thrown.	Many	martyrs	have	given	their	lives	for	obeying
God	over	their	governments.	How	many	of	you	reading	this	book	would	be
willing	to	lose	your	job	rather	than	agree	to	refrain	from	praying	or	sharing	the
gospel	at	work?
I	strongly	recommend	that	anyone	involved	in	any	way	in	spiritual	warfare	read
the	book	Spiritual	Authority,	by	Watchman	Nee.
#8)	Never	under	estimate	Satan’s	power,	or	treat	him	with	disrespect,	or	think
that	he	cannot	or	is	not	active	in	your	life.
“Likewise	also	these	filthy	dreamers	defile	the	flesh,	despise	dominion,
and	speak	evil	of	dignities.	Yet	Michael	the	archangel	when	contending
with	the	devil	he	disputed	about	the	body	of	Moses,	durst	not	bring
against	him	a	railing	accusation,	but	said,	‘The	Lord	rebuke	thee.’	But
these	speak	evil	of	those	things	which	they	know	not	...”	Jude	verses	8-9
“Be	sober,	be	vigilant;	because	your	adversary	the	devil,	as	a	roaring
lion,	walketh	about,	seeking	whom	he	may	devour.”	II	Peter	5:8
Never	forget	that	the	battle	is	real.	If	you	get	on	the	front	lines	you	are	more
likely	to	get	shot	down.	In	almost	every	disaster	I	have	ever	seen	where	someone
who	was	fighting	for	the	Lord	and	then	became	deceived	by	Satan,	the	first	step
was	their	loss	of	respect	for	their	enemy.	We	are	not	giving	any	glory	or	honor
to	Satan!	But	he	is	a	formidable	foe.	He	is	much	more	intelligent	than	we.	Don’t
forget	what	God	said	when	he	created	Satan:
“Thou	sealest	up	the	sum,	full	of	wisdom	and	perfect	in	beauty.”	Ezekiel
28:12
Satan	is	the	most	beautiful	and	intelligent	creature	God	has	created.	We	cannot
hope	to	overcome	Satan	with	our	small	human	intelligences,	or	to	figure	out	his
deceptions.	We	must	remain	totally	dependent	upon	the	Lord	to	reveal	to	us
Satan’s	tactics.	We	can	stand	against	and	overcome	Satan	only	with	the	power	of
Jesus	Christ.
As	soon	as	someone	stops	respecting	Satan,	he	becomes	careless	and	the
doorway	is	opened	for	pride	and	a	multitude	of	other	deceptions	by	Satan.

We	will	discuss	here	five	areas	of	battle.	We	certainly	do	not	claim	that	the
following	is	complete,	but	the	Lord	has	directed	us	to	share	with	you	what	we
have	learned	so	far.	It	is	our	earnest	prayer	that	the	Lord	Himself	will	lead	you
into	all	spiritual	understanding.	The	areas	are:	demons,	human	spirits	of
satanists,	physical	creatures	such	as	the	wer	animals	(the	word	lycanthrope	refers
only	to	werwolves,	not	to	other	wer	animals),	humans,	and	directly	on	the
spiritual	battlefield	in	your	spiritual	body.
Two	special	sources	of	instruction	on	how	to	fight	in	spiritual	warfare	is	the
Psalms	and	the	book	of	Joshua.	Every	weapon	mentioned	in	the	Bible	is
available	for	us	to	use	in	the	spirit	world.	Study	the	scriptures.	Get	a	notebook
and	write	down	everything	the	Lord	reveals	to	you	as	you	read.	That	way	you
will	have	the	information	so	that	you	can	go	back	and	review	frequently.
Otherwise	you	will	have	to	waste	a	lot	of	time	re-learning	things	you	once	knew
but	had	forgotten.

DEMONS
Demons	are	very	intelligent	creatures.	They	are	spirits,	and	do	not	normally	have
physical	bodies	although	they	can,	for	certain	periods	of	time	manifest	as	a
physical	body	that	we	can	see	and	feel.	They	were	once	angels	in	God’s	service.
Satan,	their	leader,	was	once	an	archangel.	His	is	one	of	the	most	powerful	and
intelligent	creatures	God	ever	created.	Man’s	intelligence	is	nothing	compared	to
Satan’s.	Many,	many	ages	ago	Satan	chose	to	rebel	against	God	and	tried	to
exalt	himself	above	God.	A	large	number	of	angels	followed	Satan	to	be	in	his
service	instead	of	God’s.	These	angels	are	often	referred	to	as	“fallen	angels”
and	are	the	various	demons.	They	are	all	evil	and	tiers.	They	go	by	different
names	in	various	parts	of	the	world.	They	have	a	wide	range	of	strengths	and
abilities	and	can	be	defeated	only	with	the	power	of	Jesus.	In	Jesus	we	are	in	a
remarkable	position	of	authority	over	demons	and	we	should	make	use	of	that
authority,	but	always	respectfully.
The	number	and	various	types	of	demons	are	so	vast	that	we	could	never	name
them	all.	Also,	the	same	demon	will	take	different	names	depending	on	what
geographical	area	he	is	in.	Satan’s	kingdom	is	highly	organized	and	very
efficient.	Very	high	demons	referred	to	in	the	Bible	as	princes	rule	over	various
areas	of	the	world.
Demons	know	the	Bible	very	well,	that	is	why	we	must	also	know	the	Bible
thoroughly.	Demons	are	expert	at	twisting	the	scriptures	to	try	to	make	them
mean	something	other	than	what	God	said.	If	we	do	not	know	the	scriptures	we
will	be	easy	prey	for	them.
We	find	no	need	to	attempt	to	list	or	name	demons	because	not	only	is	this	an
impossible	task,	but	each	time	we	need	to	deal	with	them	the	Holy	Spirit	gives
us	the	wisdom	we	need.
Time	and	space	does	not	permit	us	to	talk	much	about	deliverance	here	other
than	the	details	given	in	Elaine’s	case	and	the	other	cases	I	have	given.	We
approach	deliverance	by	areas	of	the	person,	and	by	the	known	doorways	that
have	been	opened	in	their	lives.	Later	publications	will	deal	with	this	in	more
detail.

HUMAN	SPIRITS	OF	SATANISTS
Dealing	with	the	human	spirits	of	the	satanists	is	about	the	same	as	dealing	with
demons	except	you	must	always	remember	that	it	is	a	human	life	and	spirit	you
are	dealing	with,	therefore	the	primary	goal	is	salvation.	We	accept	a	lot	more
torment	from	human	spirits	without	fighting	back	than	from	demons	because	we
do	not	wish	to	injure	them,	and	we	always	preach	the	gospel	to	them.
I	remember	on	evening	shortly	after	Elaine’s	final	deliverance	when	I	was
standing	in	the	kitchen	after	dinner	doing	the	dishes.	I	was	alone	and	crying	into
my	dish	water	while	praying	to	Father.	It	had	been	a	particularly	rough	day.
Elaine	and	I	were	being	continuously	tormented	by	the	satanists’	spirits.	Nothing
seemed	to	control	them.	We	were	almost	constantly	being	picked	up	by	these
unseen	forces	and	thrown	against	a	wall	or	onto	the	floor	or	objects	were	thrown
at	us.	We	were	exhausted	and	battered.	We	could	stop	the	demons	rather	easily
by	simply	rebuking	them	in	the	name	of	Jesus,	but	these	human	spirits	could	not
be	stopped	in	the	same	manner.	I	cried	out	to	the	Lord	in	desperation,	“Father
please,	what	can	we	do?	I	feel	like	my	house	is	an	open	thoroughfare	to	any
power	or	spirit	of	evil	that	wants	to	come	through.	You	know	how	these	spirits
are	tormenting	us.	I	just	can’t	stand	it	anymore!”
At	that	point	the	Holy	Spirit	flooded	into	my	mind	the	story	of	the	passover	lamb
in	Exodus	chapter	12.	Then	He	said,	“Since	the	death	of	Jesus,	there	are	no	more
blood	sacrifices.	So,	what	would	you	say	is	the	counterpart	of	the	blood	today?”
“The	oil?”	I	asked.
“That	is	right.”	Then	the	Lord	also	reminded	me	of	the	scripture	in	Exodus
chapter	40	where	he	had	instructed	Moses	to	use	the	anointing	oil	also.
“And	thou	shalt	take	the	anointing	oil,	and
anoint	the	tabernacle,	and	all	that	is	therein,	and
shalt	hallow	it,	and	all	the	vessels	thereof:	and	it
shall	be	holy.”
Exodus	40:9
As	I	pondered	these	scriptures,	the	Lord	showed	me	that	I	must	take	oil	and

anoint	my	house	and	sanctify	it	holy	unto	the	Lord.	So	I	took	the	oil	I	had	on
hand	(cooking	oil)	and	placed	some	on	the	doorposts	and	lintels	of	all	the	doors,
the	doors	themselves,	and	on	each	of	the	windows.	As	I	did	so,	I	asked	the	Lord
to	sanctify	my	home	holy	unto	Himself,	and	to	seal	it	with	a	shield	of	His
precious	blood.	Then,	leaving	the	doors	open	I	went	back	into	the	house	and
stood	in	the	middle	of	it	and	asked	the	Lord	to	cleanse	it	and	drive	out	all	the	evil
spirits	currently	in	the	house.	The	change	was	immediate	and	dramatic.	My
house	was	sealed	and	no	demons	or	human	spirits	could	get	in	from	that	point
on.
When	we	are	involved	in	particularly	heavy	warfare	and,	as	usual,	have	many
people	in	and	out	of	our	house	constantly,	we	sometimes	find	it	necessary	to	reanoint	and	cleanse	our	house	occasionally.	Anyone	involved	in	spiritual	warfare
will	find	this	most	helpful.	The	Lord	has	also	taught	us	that	whenever	we	move
to	a	different	home	we	should	walk	around	the	edge	of	the	property	and	claim
that	property	for	the	Lord	asking	Him	to	sanctify	it	holy	to	Himself,	and	to	seal
and	protect	it.
If	the	Lord	shows	you	that	you	personally	are	being	afflicted	by	a	human	spirit
(not	only	that	of	a	satanist,	but	even	of	a	fellow	Christian	who	has	hatred	in	his
heart	for	you)	you	will	find	it	most	helpful	to	be	anointed	with	oil	by	a	Christian
brother	or	sister,	praying	and	asking	the	Lord	for	special	shielding	not	only	from
demonic	powers,	but	also	from	human	spirits	as	well.
Be	alert	for	the	possibility	of	human	spirits	speaking	and	acting	through	an
undelivered	person.	As	for	the	rest,	the	Holy	Spirit	will	give	you	personal
guidance	for	each	occasion	as	it	arises.

WER	BEASTS	AND	PHYSICAL	MANIFESTATIONS	OF	DEMONS
Vampires	and	werwolves	have	been	legend	for	many,	many	years.	Much	has
been	written	about	them	and	many	movies	and	stories	have	centered	around
them.	Unfortunately,	most	everyone	believes	they	are	simply	“make-believe”
fantasy	creatures,	and	almost	everything	told	about	them	is	inaccurate.
These	creatures	do	exist.	Let	me	define	what	I	mean	by	wer	beasts	and	vampires,
then	let	us	look	at	some	interesting	scriptural	references.
“Behold,	I	was	shapen	in	iniquity;	and	in	sin	did	my	mother	conceive
me.”	Psalm	51:5
Ever	since	the	fall	of	Adam,	humans	have	been	born	sinful,	and	their	physical
bodies	shaped	in	and	peculiarly	affected	by	iniquity.	(Iniquity	means
wickedness.)	Because	of	this	the	demons	have	great	power	over	our	physical
bodies.	People	totally	committed	to	Satan	can	and	do	ask	certain	demons	to	live
in	them	that	are	capable	of	bringing	about	tremendous	physical	changes	in	their
bodies.	It	is	well	known	that	demons	can	give	humans	unusual	strength.
Remember	the	demoniac	of	Gadarah	in	Luke	8.	Wer	beasts	are	produced	by
these	demons.	The	demons	bring	about	the	physical	changes	in	the	person’s
body	that	change	them	into	animal-like	shapes	and	also	gives	them	super-human
strength	and	characteristics.
There	are	some	very	interesting	scriptures	on	this	subject.	Of	course	the	term
wer	animals	or	wer	beasts	is	not	used	as	that	is	a	fairly	modern	term.	But	let	us
look	at	the	following:
“And	I	will	give	peace	in	the	land	...	and	I	will
rid	evil	beasts	out	of	the	land.”	Leviticus	26:6	“I
will	also	send	wild	beasts	among	you	...	”
Leviticus	26:22
In	these	two	references	a	clear	distinction	is	made	between	evil	beasts	and	wild
beasts.	God	is	here	telling	the	Israelites	that	if	they	obey	His	commandments	that
He	will	rid	the	land	of	the	Canaanites	of	evil	beasts,	but	that	if	they	do	not	keep
His	commandments	He	will	send	in	wild	beasts	to	kill	them.	Earlier	on	when

God	gave	Moses	the	law,	He	designated	certain	animals	clean	and	unclean
among	both	wild	and	domestic	animals.	So	evil	beasts	clearly	means	something
different	from	unclean	beasts.
“	...	[God	speaking]	the	wild	beasts	of	the	field	are	mine	...”	Psalm	50:11
There	are	numerous	references	to	wild	beasts	belonging	to	the	Lord,	but	never	to
evil	beasts	belonging	to	Him.
Then	we	find	a	most	interesting	scripture	in	Ezekiel.	Here,	the	Lord	is
instructing	Ezekiel	to	go	into	the	temple	at	Jerusalem	to	see	the	evil	that	was
being	practiced	there.	At	this	time	the	Israelites	were	practicing	demon	and
Satan	worship	with	all	the	perversions	that	accompany	it.
“And	he	[God]	said	unto	me,	go	in,	and	behold
the	wicked	abominations	that	they	do	here.	So	I
went	in	and	saw;	and	behold	every	form	of
creeping	things,	and	abominable	beasts,	and	all
the	idols	of	the	house	of	Israel,	portrayed	upon
the	wall	round	about.”
Ezekiel	8:9-10
In	a	previously	referenced	scripture	in	I	Corinthians	10:19-20,	it	is	clearly	stated
that	these	idols	were	images	of	the	demons	that	were	worshiped.	I	believe	that
the	drawings	which	Ezekiel	saw	were	not	only	of	demons,	but	also	of	wer	beasts.
Israel	has	been	in	Egypt	for	over	400	years	prior	to	this	time.	The	hyroglyphics
found	throughout	Egypt	contain	drawings	of	creatures	part	human	part	beast,
especially	of	human	bodies	with	wolf	heads.	There	are	many	references	in
scripture	to	show	that	the	Israelites	carried	the	Egyptian	traditions	and	forms	of
worship	with	them.
References	to	evil	beasts	are	also	made	in	the	New	Testament.	I	believe	the
following	scriptures	are	referring	to	what	we	call	wer	beasts	today.
“One	of	themselves,	even	a	prophet	of	their	own,	said,	‘The	Cretians	are
always	liars,	evil	beasts,	slow	bellies.’	This	witness	is	true.”	Titus	1:1213a
“Even	as	Sodom	and	Gomorrah,	and	the	cities
about

about
them	in	like	manner,	giving	themselves	over	to
fornication,	and	going	after	strange	flesh,	are	set
forth
for	an	example,	suffering	the	vengeance	of
eternal	fire.
Likewise	also	these	filthy	dreamers	defile	the
flesh,
despise	dominion,	and	speak	evil	of	dignities
[demons]...	But	these	speak	evil	of	those	things
which
they	know	not:	but	what	they	know	naturally,	as
brute
beasts,	in	those	things	they	corrupt	themselves.
Woe
unto	them!	for	they	have	gone	in	the	way	of
Cain,	and
ran	greedily	after	the	error	of	Balaam	...	[The
error	of
Balaam	was	demon	worship,	specifically
Baal.]”
Jude	7-11
An	almost	identical	passage	is	found	in	II	Peter	2:10-12.	This	passage	shows
how	men	are	corrupted	and	turned	into	beasts	by	lacking	respect	for	and
consorting	with	and	worshiping	demons.	There	is	also	clear	reference	to	a
special	defiling	of	the	flesh	and	a	reference	to	“strange	flesh.”
Much	is	hidden	in	the	scriptures	and	we	must	seek	wisdom	from	the	Lord	to
understand	all	this,	but	we	believe	these	scriptures	make	reference	to	the
phenomenon	of	human	beings	literally	turned	into	evil	beasts	with	actual
temporary	physical	changes	brought	about	by	demons.
Most	people	consider	such	things	as	werwolves,	vampires	and	zombies	pure
fantasy.	Christians	need	to	understand	that	Satan	and	his	servants	are	deadly
serious	about	these	creatures	and	that	they	do	exist.	The	satanic	activity	in	the
Dark	Ages	was	so	intense	because	the	light	of	the	gospel	of	Jesus	was	almost
extinct.	Witchcraft	was	rampant	during	that	time	until	God	brought	the
Reformation	and	the	gospel	was	preached	again.	The	only	accurate	writings

about	the	existence	of	wer	animals	we	have	been	able	to	find	are	translations	of
writings	by	a	few	German	Christians	during	the	start	of	the	Reformation	period.
Our	Lord	Jesus	told	us	that	in	the	last	days	before	His	return	that	evil	would
increase	tremendously,	far	more	than	that	of	the	Dark	Ages.	Satan	is	on	the
move	and	we	are	going	to	see	more	and	more	manifestations	of	his	power.	The
explosion	of	occult	movies,	satanic	rock	music,	satanic	role	playing	fantasy
games,	occult	literature,	Eastern	religions	and	lukewarm	uncommitted	Christians
should	give	us	a	good	indication	of	the	times	we	are	in.
“[Jesus	speaking	about	the	last	days	before	His
return.]	For	then	shall	be	great	tribulation,	such
as	was	not	since	the	beginning	of	the	world	to
this	time,	no	nor	ever	shall	be.	And	except	those
days	should	be	shortened,	there	should	no	flesh
be	saved:	but	for	the	elect’s	sake	those	days
shall	be	shortened	...	For	there	shall	arise	false
Christs,	and	false	prophets,	and	shall	shew	great
signs	and	wonders;	insomuch	that,	if	it	were
possible,	they	shall	deceive	the	very	elect.”
Matthew	24:21-24
Let	us	look	at	some	of	the	lore	that	surrounds	wer	beasts	—	werwolves	in
particular.	First	of	all,	it	is	commonly	said	that	if	a	person	is	bitten	by	a	werwolf
that	he	will	become	a	werwolf.	I	feel	this	is	completely	in	error.	First	of	all,	the
scriptures	indicate	that	a	man	must	be	in	a	God-forbidden	relationship	with
demons	to	be	so	affected.	Secondly,	from	my	own	experience	and	that	of	others,
a	person	is	most	unlikely	to	simply	be	bitten	by	a	werwolf.	These	demonhumans	desire	one	thing	only	—	destruction	of	others.	If	a	werwolf	or	other	wer
beast	gets	close	enough	to	bite	someone	it	will	most	likely	tear	them	apart,	not
stop	with	just	one	bite.	Satan	uses	these	wer	beasts	for	discipline.	I	think	that
during	the	tribulation	they	will	multiply	greatly.
Other	lore	about	these	creatures	includes	such	things	as	claims	that	they	can	turn
into	their	beast	shape	only	at	night	and	only	during	the	full	moon.	I	know	both	of
these	claims	are	false,	because	I	have	personally	met	a	werwolf	fully	turned
during	daylight	and	also	at	a	time	of	the	month	when	the	moon	was	not
completely	full.

The	obvious	question	is	how	can	we	effectively	fight	against	these	creatures?	In
the	name	and	power	and	authority	of	Jesus	Christ.	I	have	not,	to	this	date,	known
of	the	deliverance	of	any	wer	beasts,	but,	the	work	of	Christ	on	the	cross	was	so
complete,	that	I	am	sure	it	is	possible	if	the	person	involved	is	willing	to	lay
down	his	life	to	obtain	deliverance.	These	people	have	so	given	over	their
physical	bodies	into	the	control	of	the	demon	that	apart	from	a	total	miracle	of
the	Lord	I	doubt	that	the	demon	can	be	cast	out	without	resulting	in	the	physical
death	of	the	person.
As	I	mentioned,	I	have,	myself,	encountered	a	werwolf	face-to-face	once	so	far.
Perhaps	it	would	be	helpful	to	describe	that	experience	here.	One	evening	at
dusk	I	was	driving	from	my	office	back	to	the	hospital	to	see	a	patient	who	had
taken	a	turn	for	the	worse.	I	was	alone	in	the	car	and	was	driving	down	a	stretch
of	isolated	country	road	where	there	were	no	houses	or	buildings	within	at	least	a
one	mile	radius.	Suddenly,	about	a	block	ahead	of	me	a	huge	werwolf	stepped
out	into	the	middle	of	the	road.	As	I	approached	closer,	he	raised	up	and	stood
on	his	hind	legs.	I	put	my	foot	down	hard	on	the	accelerator	intending	to	swerve
around	him	but	the	car	didn’t	respond.	It	glided	to	a	stop,	motor	still	running,
despite	all	my	prayers	and	attempts	to	make	it	go.	I	sat	there	staring	in	horror	at
the	most	incredibly	ugly	and	fierce	creature	I	had	ever	seen.	I	felt	as	if	I	was
drowning	in	the	pure	evil	power	that	radiated	from	him.	He	threw	back	his	head
and	howled	—	a	terrifying	sound	which	I	shall	never	forget.
Then	he	looked	straight	into	my	eyes	and	told	me,	“You	can’t	go	anywhere	—
see,	I	have	stopped	your	car	and	there’s	nothing	you	can	do	about	it.	Now	I’m
going	to	enjoy	ripping	your	throat	out	and	drinking	your	blood.	You	have	been
interfering	with	Satan	too	long;	I	am	going	to	punish	you.	You	cannot	stand
against	my	power.”	Ending	in	a	deep	growl,	he	started	walking	from	the	front	of
the	car	toward	my	door.
Fear	rolled	over	me	in	waves,	but	I	knew	I	must	stand,	as	I	was	certain	it	was	not
the	Lord’s	will	for	me	to	die	at	that	point.	I	knew	I	had	work	yet	to	do.	The	Lord
had	taught	me	well	during	my	near	fatal	illness	3	years	previously.	As	I	made
my	decision	to	stand	my	ground,	the	Holy	Spirit	flooded	such	calm	and	peace
and	strength	into	my	soul.	He	(the	Holy	Spirit)	also	flashed	the	understanding
into	my	mind	that	the	werwolf	was	trying	to	frighten	me	into	panicking	and
running.	If	I	had	done	so,	he	would	have	been	able	to	kill	me.
Taking	a	deep	breath,	I	extended	my	right	hand	to	point	directly	at	him	and	cried
out,	“STOP!	In	the	name	of	Jesus	STOP!	you	foul	servant	of	Satan!	I	am	a
servant	of	Jesus	Christ	who	is	God	almighty!	It	is	not	my	master’s	will	for	me	to

die	now.	You	may	not	touch	me	for	I	have	work	yet	to	do.”	The	werwolf	stopped
in	his	tracks,	unable	to	move,	snarling	and	growling	in	fury.
Pointing	at	him	again,	I	looked	straight	into	his	eyes	and	said,	“In	the	name	of
Jesus	I	command	you	to	get	out	of	my	way	and	be	gone!	My	hour	of	death	has
not	yet	come.	NOW	GO!”	He	howled	once	more,	then	dropped	onto	all	fours
and	disappeared	off	the	edge	of	the	road	into	a	field	of	tall	corn.
I	was	shaking	so	hard	in	relief	that	I	could	hardly	drive.	But	as	my	car	gathered
speed	I	drove	away	praising	the	Lord	for	once	again	“Extending	his	right	hand
against	the	anger	of	my	foes.”	Psalm	138:7.	(I	stopped	about	a	mile	down	the
road	and	had	a	“nervous	breakdown”	before	going	on	to	the	hospital.)
If	only	people	would	realize	the	power	available	to	them	in	Jesus.	Much	has
been	written	about	various	methods	of	effectively	killing	werwolves	while	they
are	in	their	wolf	form.	I	would	never	consider	even	trying	such	a	thing	because
in	so	doing	I	would	be	killing	a	human	who’s	salvation	is	my	deepest	concern.
Also,	once	such	a	person	is	killed,	the	demon	would	leave	the	body	immediately
and	then	the	body	would	return	to	its	human	form.	That,	of	course,	would
present	a	most	awkward	situation	because	who	would	believe	that	the	dead	body
was	ever	in	a	different	form?	The	killer	would	most	certainly	be	accused	of
murder,	and	rightly	so.
Vampires	also	exist.	This,	too,	is	a	relatively	modern	term.	Essentially,	a
vampire	is	a	person	who	drinks	blood,	with	a	particular	liking	for	human	blood.
Vampirism	is	a	current	rapidly	growing	fad	amongst	heavy	metal	Rock	stars	and
fans.	Many	songs	are	written	about	the	subject,	blood	drinking	by	Rock	stars
during	stage	performances	is	common	and	the	altering	of	their	teeth	to	become
sharp	pointed	spears	is	also	a	growing	fad	amongst	these	people.	Recent
publications	show	pictures	of	Dee	Snider,	singer	in	the	Rock	group	Twisted
Sister,	whose	front	teeth	are	now	pointed.	There	is	a	fascinating	reference	to	this
in	scripture.
“My	soul	is	among	lions:	and	I	lie	even	among	them	that	are	set	on	fire,
even	the	sons	of	men	whose	teeth	are	spears	and	arrows	...	”	Psalm	57:4
When	we	remember	that	most	of	David’s	writings	in	the	Psalms	referred	to
spiritual	warfare,	and	the	fact	that	he	says	his	soul,	not	physical	body,	was	being
attacked,	makes	me	wonder	if	he	could	be	referring	to	people	inhabited	by	these
same	demons	of	vampirism?
Again,	most	all	the	lore	concerning	vampires	is	wrong.	They	certainly	can

function	in	the	light	of	day,	do	not	need	to	sleep	in	a	coffin,	etc.	I	have	never
personally	met	a	vampire,	but	I	have	talked	with	several	people	who	claim	they
have.	In	this	case	also,	we	must	stand	firm	in	the	power	and	authority	of	Jesus
Christ.
Demons	can	and	do	manifest	in	a	physical	form.	The	forms	they	chose	to	take
can	range	from	exquisite	beauty	to	horrifying	ugliness.	Demons	can	also
manifest	in	a	physical	appearance	identical	to	an	existing	human	being.	These
demons	are	frequently	referred	to	by	satanists	as	changelings,	incubi,	or	dopplegangers.	We	must	also	stand	against	these	the	same	as	any	demon,	in	the	name
of	Jesus.

PHYSICAL	BATTLE
There	is	not	much	I	can	tell	you	about	the	inevitable	conflict	you	will	have	with
actual	humans	as	a	result	of	your	involvement	in	spiritual	warfare.	You	must
earnestly	petition	the	Lord	to	teach	you	to	hear	His	voice	clearly	and	you	must
obey,	no	matter	how	ridiculous	it	sounds	at	the	time.	Faith	and	immediate
obedience	are	two	keys.
I	will	never	forget	one	afternoon	in	the	month	of	July	(just	after	Elaine’s	final
deliverance)	when	I	arrived	home	early	from	work.	I	went	into	the	house	and
dropped	off	some	things.	As	I	had	about	45	minutes	before	I	had	to	go	pick
Elaine	up	from	work	I	decided	to	run	over	to	the	grocery	store.	I	did	so	and
arrived	back	home	in	about	20	minutes.	As	I	reached	to	put	my	key	in	the	lock	of
the	front	door	the	Holy	Spirit	flashed	one	word	into	my	spirit	and	mind.	“NO!”	I
looked	around.	Everything	seemed	peaceful.	The	birds	were	chirping,	a	gentle
breeze	rustled	the	leaves	on	the	trees,	my	two	cats	were	sleeping	on	the	front
porch	swing.	I	looked	in	the	window	next	to	the	door	but	could	see	nothing
unusual.
“I	must	be	crazy!”	I	thought.	“I	haven’t	been	away	for	more	than	20	minutes	and
it’s	broad	daylight.”	Immediately	the	command	came	again:	“NO!”
“But	Lord,”	I	said,	“I	have	ice	cream	and	it	will	melt	quickly	in	this	heat.”
“Do	not	go	in”	was	the	last	command.	Then	silence.	I	knew	in	my	heart	that	that
was	the	last	the	Lord	would	say	to	me	on	the	subject.	The	Lord	will	never	argue
with	us.	So,	with	a	shrug,	I	turned	and	went	back	to	the	car	and	went	to	wait
until	Elaine	finished	at	work.	I	had	been	too	well	schooled	by	the	Lord	to
disobey.	Half	an	hour	later	when	Elaine	and	I	and	the	melted	ice	cream	arrived
home	we	found	that	the	back	part	of	the	house	had	been	ransacked!	Whoever
had	been	there	must	have	been	in	the	house	at	the	time	the	Holy	Spirit	had
stopped	me	from	going	in.	We	praised	the	Lord	for	His	guidance.	I	might	well
have	been	killed	if	I	had	gone	in	earlier.	I	could	give	many	other	similar
experiences,	but	the	Lord	will	lead	you	in	your	own	life.
Be	very	careful	who	you	trust.	Do	not	confide	in	anyone	unless	they	have	had
time	to	prove	themselves.	What	are	the	fruits	of	their	life	and	Christian	walk?
Always	wait	until	you	have	complete	peace	in	your	spirit	and	heart	from	the
Lord	before	you	take	anyone	into	your	confidence.	Pray	constantly	asking	the

Lord	to	reveal	to	you	Satan’s	servants	and	lies.	We	can	never	outsmart	Satan.
Only	the	Lord	can	show	us	his	traps.

BATTLING	IN	THE	SPIRIT	WORLD
This	area	of	battle	was	discussed	in	chapter	14	for	better	continuity.	However,	as
with	all	the	other	areas	of	battle,	the	eight	steps	outlined	in	the	beginning	of	this
chapter	apply	here	equally.

CHAPTER	17
Destruction	Of	Christian	Churches

ELAINE	TALKS:
During	my	years	in	The	Brotherhood	I	was	carefully	trained,	and	I	in	turn
trained	others,	how	to	infiltrate	and	destroy	the	various	Christian	churches.
Satan’s	goal	is	to	make	every	Christian	church	like	the	church	of	Laodicea
described	by	our	Lord	Jesus	Christ	in	Revelation	3:15-16:
“I	know	thy	works,	that	thou	art	neither	cold	nor	hot:	I	would	thou	wert
cold	or	hot.	So	then	because	thou	art	lukewarm,	and	neither	cold	or	hot,	I
will	spue	thee	out	of	my	mouth.”
Churches	full	of	passive	people	who	never	bother	to	read	or	study	the	Bible,	who
“Having	a	form	of	godliness,	but	denying	the	power	thereof	...	”	as	so	well
described	in	II	Timothy	3:	5,	are	not	a	threat	to	Satan.
We	were	taught	a	basic	eight-point	plan	of	attack	that	could	be	adapted	to
whatever	denomination	of	church	we	were	sent	to.	The	fact	that	most	all	high
ranking	satanists	regularly	attend	Christian	churches	should	not	be	a	surprise	to
anyone.	That	is,	anyone	who	takes	the	time	to	read	God’s	word.	We	Christians
are	very	clearly	warned	that	Satan’s	attack	will	come	from	within	the	churches
—	especially	in	times	of	prosperity.
As	Paul	was	saying	“good-by”	to	the	Ephesian	elders	he	gave	them	this	warning:
“And	now,	behold,	I	know	that	ye	all,	among	whom	I	have	gone
preaching	the	kingdom	of	God,	shall	see	my	face	no	more.	Wherefore	I
take	you	to	record	this	day,	that	I	am	pure	from	the	blood	of	all	men.	For
I	have	not	shunned	to	declare	unto	you	all	the	counsel	of	God.	”Take
heed	therefore	unto	yourselves,	and	to	all	the	flock,	over	the	which	the
Holy	Ghost	hath	made	you	overseers,	to	feed	the	church	of	God,	which
he	hath	purchased	with	his	own	blood.	For	I	know	this,	that	after	my
departing	shall	grievous	wolves	enter	in	among	you,	not	sparing	the
flock.	Also	of	your	own	selves	shall	men	arise,	speaking	perverse	things,
to	draw	away	disciples	after	them.	Therefore	watch,	and	remember,	that
by	the	space	of	three	years	I	ceased	not	to	warn	every	one	night	and	day
with	tears.”	Acts	20:25-31
“For	such	are	false	apostles,	deceitful	workers,	transforming	themselves
into	the	apostles	of	Christ.	And	no	marvel;	for	Satan	himself	is
transformed	into	an	angel	of	light.	Therefore	it	is	no	great	thing	if	his
ministers	also	be	transformed	as	the	ministers	of	righteousness;	whose

ministers	also	be	transformed	as	the	ministers	of	righteousness;	whose
end	shall	be	according	to	their	works.”
II	Corinthians	11:13-15
“For	there	are	certain	men	crept	in	unawares,	who	were	before	of	old
ordained	to	this	condemnation,	ungodly	men,	turning	the	grace	of	our
God	into	lasciviousness,	and	denying	the	only	Lord	God,	and	our	Lord
Jesus	Christ.”	Jude	4
These	scriptures	make	it	very	plain	that	Satan’s	attack	will	come	from	within	our
churches.	We	are	not	trying	to	start	a	witch	hunt,	rather	our	desire	is	to	show	you
the	main	tactics	Satan	uses	so	that	you	can	stop	any	such	activities	within	your
own	churches.	Each	individual	is	responsible	before	God	to	be	vigilant	and	alert,
to	read	and	prayerfully	study	God’s	word	(the	Bible),	to	carefully	listen	to	what
is	being	taught	within	their	church.	Any	teaching	that	does	not	agree	with	God’s
word	must	be	challenged,	no	matter	who	is	teaching	it.	But	the	challenging	must
be	done	in	love	,	and	gently,	but	firmly.	Paul	gave	some	very	good	advice	to
Timothy	on	this	subject:
“Rebuke	not	an	elder,	but	intreat	him	as	a	father;
and	the	younger	men	as	brethren;	the	elder
women	as	mothers;	the	younger	as	sisters,	with
all	purity.”
I	Timothy	5:1
The	word	intreat	means	to	ask	earnestly,	beseech;	implore,	with	respect.	Never
forget	that	Jesus	loves	these	people	and	died	for	them	just	the	same	as	He	did	for
you	and	me.	Your	purpose	is	not	to	expose	them,	but	to	control	them	and	get
them	saved.
Please	do	not	forget	my	own	experience.	The	little	church	I	was	sent	to	destroy
knew	that	I	was	a	witch,	but	they	did	not	publicly	expose	me	or	challenge	me.	If
they	had	done	so	I	would	have	been	killed	immediately.	Instead,	they	loved	me,
controlled	me	so	that	I	could	not	bring	in	destructive	doctrine	and	prayed	for	me
until	finally	I	was	saved.
Here	are	the	basic	8	points	of	attack	taught	by	Satan	to	his	servants	to	be	used	in
the	destruction	of	Christian	churches:

#1)	Profession	of	Faith
First	of	all	the	satanist	must	make	a	“profession	of	faith.”	He	or	she	must	pretend
to	be	saved	in	order	to	gain	credibility	with	the	church	people.	In	churches	who
have	altar	calls,	the	person	will	go	forward,	usually	with	tears,	and	pretend	to
“get	saved.”	If	the	particular	church	is	a	charismatic	church	which	places	great
emphasis	on	the	gift	of	speaking	in	tongues,	the	satanist	will	speak	in	tongues.
This	is	no	problem,	demons	can	speak	in	tongues	very	easily.	Remember	that
when	I	was	indwelt	by	Mann-Chan	I	was	able	to	address	any	of	the	foreign
dignitaries	in	their	own	language	fluently.	This	is	why	the	Lord	places	such
emphasis	on	interpretation:
“When	ye	come	together	...	If	any	man	speak	in
an	unknown	tongue,	let	it	be	by	two	or	at	the
most	by	three,	and	that	by	course;	and	let	one
interpret.	But	if	there	be	no	interpreter,	let	him
keep	silence	in	the	church;	and	let	him	speak	to
himself,	and	to	God.”
I	Corinthians	14:26-28
Alas,	how	much	damage	is	done	because	churches	do	not	heed	this	simple
warning.	It	is	the	custom	in	charismatic	churches	for	many	people	to	speak	and
pray	in	tongues	at	the	same	time	without	interpretation	during	their	services	and
prayer	meetings.	Satanists	take	great	advantage	of	this.	During	the	time	I	served
Satan,	I	spoke	in	tongues	regularly	in	all	the	meetings	and	prayer	meetings,	so
did	the	other	satanists	I	was	working	with.	No	one	interpreted.	We	were	cursing
the	church,	the	pastor,	the	members,	and	God!	And	No	one	knew!	We	challenge
churches	everywhere	to	take	heed	of	this	scripture.	When	you	come	together	as	a
group,	restrict	your	speaking	in	tongues	as	the	scripture	directs.	If	you	do	so,	you
will	have	taken	a	major	step	in	restricting	Satan’s	attack	on	you.
Three	other	scriptures	most	churches	overlook	are:
“Beloved,	believe	not	every	spirit,	but	try	the	spirits	whether	they	are	of
God:	because	many	false	prophets	are	gone	out	into	the	world.	Hereby
know	ye	the	Spirit	of	God:	Every	spirit	that	confesseth	that	Jesus	Christ
is	come	in	the	flesh	is	of	God:	And	every	spirit	that	confesseth	not	that

is	come	in	the	flesh	is	of	God:	And	every	spirit	that	confesseth	not	that
Jesus	Christ	is	come	in	the	flesh	is	not	of	God:	and	this	is	that	spirit	of
antichrist,	whereof	ye	have	heard	that	it	should	come;	and	even	now
already	is	it	in	the	world.”	I	John	4:1-3
“And	he	said,	take	heed	that	ye	be	not	deceived:	for	many	shall	come	in
my	name	...	”	Luke	21:8
“Not	every	one	that	saith	unto	me,	Lord,	Lord,	shall	enter	into	the
kingdom	of	heaven;	but	he	that	doeth	the	will	of	my	Father	which	is	in
heaven.	Many	will	say	to	me	in	that	day,	Lord,	Lord,	have	we	not
prophesied	in	thy	name?	and	in	thy	name	have	cast	out	devils?	and	in	thy
name	done	many	wonderful	works?	And	then	will	I	profess	unto	them,	I
never	knew	you:	depart	from	me,	ye	that	work	iniquity.”	Matthew	7:2123
This	seems	to	be	one	of	the	areas	of	greatest	confusion	amongst	Christians.
Satanists	can	and	do	use	the	name	of	Jesus.	They	can	teach	and	preach	about
Jesus,	they	can	use	the	name	of	Jesus	in	prayer,	etc.	The	scriptures	just	quoted	in
Luke	and	Matthew	clearly	show	this.	The	one	thing	they	can’t	do	is	pass	the	test
given	in	I	John	4.	They	cannot	look	you	square	in	the	eye	and	say,	“Jesus	Christ
who	is	God,	who	came	in	the	flesh,	died	on	the	cross	and	three	days	later	arose
from	the	grave	and	now	sits	at	the	right	hand	of	God	the	Father,	this	Jesus	is	my
Lord	and	Savior	and	Master.”	Oh,	they	can	say	“Jesus	saved	me.”	But	which
Jesus	are	they	talking	about?	Jesus	Himself	said	that	many	would	come	claiming
to	be	Him.	They	can	also	read	or	repeat	a	confession	or	profession	of	faith	in
Jesus	Christ.	They	can	and	do	read	the	scriptures.	If	you	ask	them	if	Jesus	Christ
who	came	in	the	flesh	is	their	Savior,	they	can	lie	and	say	“Yes.”	But	they
cannot,	with	their	own	mouth,	make	the	declaration	as	given	above.	God	gave	us
a	test	to	use,	dear	brothers	and	sisters	in	Christ.	Let	us	use	God’s	word.

#2)	Build	Credibility
Satanists	build	credibility	within	the	Christian	churches	in	many	ways,
depending	upon	the	particular	church.	They	are	regular	attenders.	They	can	be
counted	upon	to	always	be	ready	and	willing	to	help	in	any	project.	Not	only	do
they	build	credibility	in	this	way,	but	they	also	get	to	know	the	church	and	its
members.	It	doesn’t	take	long	for	them	to	find	out	who	is	truly	committed	to
Christ	and	who	is	not.
Money	is	another	big	tool.	If	the	church	is	a	large	and	wealthy	one	they	give
regularly,	gradually	increasing	the	amounts	they	give	until	they	are	one	of	the
main	supports	of	the	church	financially.	In	small	churches	where	the	members
are	mostly	poor,	they	do	not	flash	around	a	lot	of	money,	but	gradually	and
carefully	increase	their	giving	until	many	of	the	programs	within	the	church
become	dependant	upon	their	financial	support.	Of	course	The	Brotherhood
provides	the	money	they	give,	and	money	talks!	Unfortuantely	this	is	true	even
in	our	Christian	churches.	Rarely	will	you	find	poor	people	on	the	board	of
directors	of	any	church.

#3)	Destroy	the	Prayer	Base
“Praying	always	with	all	prayer	and	supplication	in	the	Spirit,	and
watching	thereunto	with	all	perseverance	and	supplication	for	all	saints;”
Ephesians	6:18
The	single	most	important	goal	of	the	satanists	is	to	knock	prayer	out	of	the
church.	There	are	so	many	scriptures	about	prayer	that	we	could	not	begin	to	list
them	all.	A	strong	church	is	a	praying	church.	Prayer	requires	self-discipline,
and	unfortunately	the	majority	of	Christians	spend	very	little	time	in	prayer.	Let
me	give	you	a	true	story	of	how	a	satanist	destroyed	the	power	of	the	very
church	in	which	I	was	delivered.	Rebecca	and	I	are	broken	hearted	over	what
happened,	but	we	could	not	get	the	leaders	of	that	church	to	listen	to	us.
Shortly	after	I	was	completely	delivered,	we	were	horrified	to	see	that	the	high
priest	of	the	large	and	powerful	coven	of	the	city	in	which	our	home	church	was
located,	started	attending	our	church.	I	knew	the	man	and	his	family	personally
while	I	was	still	in	Satanism,	and	he	personally	threatened	both	Rebecca	and
myself	on	more	than	one	occasion.	Within	two	short	years,	he	and	his	coworkers	completely	destroyed	this	wonderful	and	powerful	church!	Many	times
Rebecca	and	I	pled	in	tears	with	the	pastor	and	some	of	the	elders	to	stop	what
was	happening	within	the	church,	but	they	would	not	listen	to	us.	We	could	not
accuse	“Roy”	(not	his	real	name)	of	being	a	satanist	because,	of	course,	we	had
no	proof.	It	would	have	been	our	word	against	his.	But	we	did	try	to	show	the
pastor	and	a	couple	of	the	elders	on	more	than	one	occasion	that	the	fruits	of	his
life	were	not	scriptural.	Here	is	what	he	did.
Roy	was	very	wealthy.	He	joined	the	church	shortly	after	he	started	attending	it.
He	claimed	to	be	well	grounded	and	knowledgeable	in	the	scriptures,	which	he
was.	He	contributed	large	sums	to	the	church,	attended	every	meeting	and
activity,	and	joined	the	choir.	At	that	time	our	church	had	an	extremely	powerful
prayer	meeting	every	Wednesday	night.	Every	week	200-300	people	attended
the	prayer	meeting	and	prayed	as	a	unified	body.	We	have	been	in	prayer
meetings	so	powerful	that	the	power	of	the	Holy	Spirit	literally	shook	the	church
building.	These	people	were	serious	about	prayer.
Then,	as	would	be	expected,	the	church	began	to	experience	tremendous	growth.
Its	membership	grew	from	300	to	over	a	thousand	in	less	than	a	year.	This	is	an
exceedingly	dangerous	time	for	any	church.	The	pastor	and	the	elders	were	no

longer	able	to	know	every	member	personally.	Instead	of	dividing	the	church
into	a	sister	church	to	keep	down	the	number	of	members	to	a	manageable
number,	they	built	an	addition	onto	the	church,	and	the	church	keep	on	growing
rapidly.	Everyone	thought	they	were	being	richly	blessed	by	God	—	and	so	they
were.	But	many	of	the	newcomers	were	satanists	posing	as	Christians.
Less	than	6	months	after	joining	the	church	Roy	stepped	forward	and	told	the
church	that	God	had	put	a	great	burden	on	his	heart	for	America.	He	said	that
God	wanted	the	men	of	the	church	to	start	coming	once	a	week	at	noon	to	spend
an	hour	in	prayer	for	our	country.	He	was	willing	to	lead	the	group.	Everyone
thought	this	was	wonderful,	and	Roy	was	much	looked	up	to	within	the	church.
Within	a	couple	of	months	he	was	made	an	elder,	and	shortly	after	that	elected	to
the	board	of	directors.
About	4	months	after	establishing	the	“Prayer	for	America”	group,	he	launched
his	next	two-pronged	attack.	He	and	his	wife	and	about	20	choir	members
tearfully	told	the	choir	leader	that	they	must	stop	attending	choir	because	it	“took
too	much	time	away	from	their	families.”	They	claimed	that	it	was	too	much	of	a
burden	to	have	to	attend	the	Wednesday	night	prayer	meeting,	then	go	to	choir
practice	after	the	prayer	meeting.	Needless	to	say,	it	didn’t	take	long	for	the
choir	director	to	approach	the	elders	about	having	choir	practice	during	the
prayer	meeting,	and	“Of	course	having	their	own	prayer	just	before	practice.”
The	elders	agreed,	and	the	20	members	rejoined.	The	first	attack	had	been	a
success.	Because	the	choir	was	large,	a	significant	portion	of	the	church
members	were	now	neither	praying	nor	benefiting	from	those	powerful	prayer
meetings.	Most	of	the	other	church	members	began	to	wonder	if	the	prayer
meeting	was	so	terribly	important	after	all.
About	a	month	after	the	victory	with	the	choir,	Roy	attacked	at	a	meeting	of	both
the	elders	and	board	of	directors.	Roy	told	them	that	because	of	the	fast	rate	of
growth	of	the	church	that	not	enough	time	was	being	spent	teaching	individuals
to	grow	in	the	Lord,	or	about	how	to	share	the	gospel	with	others.	He	said	that
the	Sunday	schools	just	couldn’t	do	the	job.	He	also	pointed	out	the	fact	that
people	did	not	know	each	other	personally	as	they	used	to	when	the	church	was
smaller	—	all	valid	points.	BUT	his	solution	to	the	problem	was	to	stop	the	large
unified	prayer	group	and	split	everyone	up	into	small	“discipleship	groups”
where	they	could	be	“individually	taught”	how	to	“grow	and	evangelize”	and	get
to	know	one	another	better.	The	pastor,	the	elders	and	the	board	of	directors
swallowed	the	bait	hook,	line	and	sinker.
The	prayer	meeting	was	disbanded	and	small	discipleship	groups	formed.	Of
course,	Roy	was	in	charge	of	forming	the	groups.	The	people	he	chose	to	lead

course,	Roy	was	in	charge	of	forming	the	groups.	The	people	he	chose	to	lead
them	were	mostly	satanists.	The	prayer	and	the	power	of	the	church	was
destroyed!
Rebecca	and	I	went	to	the	pastor	and	some	of	the	elders	in	tears,	trying	to	show
them	scripturally	that	those	powerful	prayer	meetings	were	the	backbone	of	the
church.	They	refused	to	listen	to	us.	From	each	one	we	heard	the	same	excuse,
“Roy	is	the	first	one	to	know	about	the	importance	of	prayer.	Look	how	he
started	the	‘Pray	for	America’	group.”
Many	of	the	strongest	Christians	in	the	church	shortly	left	to	attend	other
churches.	Within	a	year	the	church	was	in	a	shambles.	The	pastor	became
discouraged	and	left	the	church,	the	older	and	strong	members	of	the	church	left,
the	power	of	the	church	was	gone.
Do	you	see	how	easy	it	is?	Is,	or	has,	this	happened	within	your	own	church?
Don’t	just	leave	the	church,	please	stand	and	fight	Satan.	Put	prayer	back	into
your	church!

#4)	Rumors
Once	the	prayer	base	of	the	church	has	been	destroyed,	the	satanists	are	free	to
do	about	anything	they	want.	One	of	the	easiest	things	to	use	is	rumors.	Gossip
is	Satan’s	prime	tool.	Very	few	people	are	strong	enough	not	to	pass	along	a
rumor	they	have	heard.	Satanists	can	easily	destroy	the	credibility	of	the	pastor
and	the	true	Christians	within	a	church	by	starting	rumors.
We	urge	all	church	leaders	to	be	very	careful.	Never	go	alone	to	the	home	of	a
member	of	the	church	of	the	opposite	sex	to	help	or	counsel	them.	You	can	be
framed	so	easily.	Even	if	you	did	nothing	unseemly	or	wrong,	who	can	prove	it?
Many	a	pastor’s	career	had	been	destroyed	by	just	such	set-ups.	I	Thessalonians
5:22	says,	“Abstain	from	all	appearance	of	evil.”	Every	Christian	would	do	well
to	carefully	follow	that	scripture.

#5)	Teach	and	Change	Doctrines
Satanists	particularly	covet	teaching	positions	within	the	churches.	They	can	do
tremendous	damage	in	these	positions.	Do	you	really	know	where	all	of	your
Sunday	school	teachers	stand	with	the	Lord?	Do	you	really	know	just	what	they
are	teaching	to	your	children?	Or	to	anyone	else	for	that	matter.	I	taught	Sunday
school	in	a	large	Bible-believing	charismatic	church	in	my	home	town	for
several	years,	and	led	and	taught	the	youth	choir,	while	at	the	same	time	serving
Satan.	My	heart	breaks	now	as	I	think	of	the	many	young	lives	I	destroyed	by
recruiting	them	into	Satanism	through	those	classes,	and	the	countless	others
whose	time	I	wasted	by	not	teaching	them	the	true	gospel	of	Jesus	Christ.
Do	not	be	deceived.	A	number	of	ministers	of	large	and	wealthy	churches	in	our
country	are	satanists.	Their	influence	is	far	reaching,	and	they	get	away	with
doing	what	they	do	because	Christians	everywhere	are	too	lazy	to	study	their
own	Bibles	to	check	out	what	they	are	saying!
There	are	three	basic	areas	satanists	teach	most	about:
a.	Prayer.	They	make	prayer	a	very	complicated	procedure.	They	often
teach	that	there	are	a	number	of	steps	the	believer	must	go	through	to	be
sure	they	are	in	a	“right”	relationship	with	God	before	they	have	any
power	in	prayer,	or	even	before	God	will	hear	them.	They	use	and	twist
many	scriptures	to	make	their	false	doctrines	look	legitimate.	Untold
numbers	of	people	are	discouraged	from	praying	at	all	because	prayer	is
presented	as	such	a	burdensome	and	complex	thing.	We	encourage
everyone	to	study	Hebrews	4:14-16:
“Seeing	then	that	we	have	a	great	high	priest,	that	is	passed	into
the	heavens,	Jesus	the	Son	of	God,	let	us	hold	fast	our	profession.
For	we	have	not	an	high	priest	which	cannot	be	touched	with	the
feeling	of	our	infirmities;	but	was	in	all	points	tempted	like	as	we
are,	yet	without	sin.	Let	us	therefore	come	boldly	unto	the	throne
of	grace,	that	we	may	obtain	mercy,	and	find	grace	to	help	in	time
of	need.”	Hebrews	4:14-16
b.	One	of	the	most	destructive	Satanic	doctrines	of	today	is	the	health-andwealth	message.	One	of	the	best	ways	to	keep	people	from	being	willing
to	suffer	anything	to	help	out	a	brother	and	to	discourage	a	true	Christian

undergoing	persecution	(it	does	happen	in	our	country	every	day)	is	the
teaching	that	every	Christian	should	be	healthy	all	the	time,	and	wealthy.
Anyone	who	is	not	is	failing	in	some	area	of	his	or	her	life.	The
scriptures	showing	that	the	falsehoods	of	this	doctrine	are	too	numerous
to	list.	One	brief	verse	that	about	covers	it	all	states:
“Yea,	and	all	that	will	live	godly	in	Christ	Jesus	shall	suffer
persecution.”	II	Timothy	3:12
Please	take	note	that	there	are	no	limitations	on	just	what	kind	of
persecution	the	believer	will	suffer	-	it	could	be	financial,	physical,	or
emotional.
c.	The	love	doctrine	-	“We	can’t	judge	anybody.”	Satanists	protect
themselves	by	this	doctrine,	and	passive	Christians	don’t	want	to	step	on
anyone’s	toes.	They	just	don’t	want	to	be	bothered	because	if	they	did,
their	quiet	little	well-planned	prosperous	lives	might	not	be	so	quiet	and
prosperous	any	longer.

#6)	Break	Up	Family	Units
Satan	knows	that	if	he	can	successfully	break	up	the	family	unit,	he	will	also
break	up	the	unity	of	the	church,	and,	I	might	add,	of	our	nation.	Satanists	within
Christian	churches	work	hard	to	separate	families.	They	start	all	sorts	of
programs	for	teenagers,	school	age,	and	preschool	children.	They	develop
separate	programs	for	women	and	men,	so	as	to	keep	the	parents	separated	as
much	as	possible	also.
Children	need	to	listen	to	the	sermons	and	join	in	the	prayer	meetings	just	as
much	as	the	parents.	All	through	the	Bible	the	principle	of	learning	by	joining	in
with	parents	is	shown.	Children	learn	respect	both	for	God	and	the	church	by
learning	to	sit	quietly	in	church	and	listening	to	the	pastor.	Immediately	after
programs	are	provided	for	young	people	separating	them	from	the	main	church
services,	they	lose	respect	for	the	pastor	and	the	church.	THEY	don’t	have	to	sit
and	listen	to	the	pastor,	he	is	just	too	boring.	This	is	the	attitude	they	quickly
develop.
What	better	way	for	children	to	learn	to	pray	than	by	joining	in	with	their
parents?	Husbands	and	wives	are	constantly	under	attack	by	Satan.	In	this	day	of
easy	divorce,	couples	need	to	spend	time	together	to	stay	unified.	Separating
them	within	the	church,	and	for	such	things	as	retreats,	etc.	is	a	big	step	towards
driving	wedges	between	husbands	and	wives.

#7)	Stop	All	Accurate	Teaching	About	Satan
“Lest	Satan	should	get	an	advantage	of	us:	for	we	are	not	ignorant	of	his
devices.”	II	Corinthians	2:11
“My	people	are	destroyed	for	lack	of	knowledge:	because	thou	hast
rejected	knowledge,	I	will	also	reject	thee,	that	thou	shalt	be	no	priest	to
me:	seeing	thou	hast	forgotten	the	law	of	thy	God,	I	will	also	forget	thy
children.”	Hosea	4:6
“Be	sober,	be	vigilant;	because	your	adversary	the	devil,	as	a	roaring
lion,	walketh	about,	seeking	whom	he	may	devour.”	I	Peter	5:8
“And	this	is	the	condemnation,	that	light	is	come	into	the	world,	and	men
loved	darkness	rather	than	light,	because	their	deeds	were	evil.”	John
3:19
One	of	the	major	goals	of	Satan	and	his	servants	is	to	prevent	any	teaching	about
him	or	his	activities.	As	long	as	people	remain	ignorant	about	Satan	he	is
relatively	unhindered	in	anything	he	chooses	to	do.	Satanists	are	always
commanded	to	prevent	any	teaching	about	Satan	within	the	churches	they	attend.
The	excuses	are	many.	They	say	that	any	teaching	about	Satan	gives	glory	to
him,	takes	people’s	minds	off	of	the	Lord,	tempts	people	to	turn	to	Satan,	etc.,
etc.,	ad	infinitum.	God’s	word	clearly	teaches	much	about	Satan,	and	warns	us
that	if	we	are	ignorant	about	our	enemy	he	will	surely	gain	an	advantage	over	us.
One	simple	incantation	by	a	high	satanist	will	assign	a	demon	to	every	person
attending	the	church	in	which	he	is	involved.	The	purpose	of	the	demon	is	to
stand	guard	and	the	instant	anyone	says	anything	about	Satan,	to	beam	thoughts
into	the	person’s	mind	that	he	or	she	should	not	be	listening	to	anything	about
Satan.
Beware,	the	very	church	members	who	complain	the	loudest	about	any	teaching
about	Satan	and	his	tactics,	will	probably	turn	out	to	be	satanists	themselves.

#8)	Direct	Attacks	By	Witchcraft	Against	Key	Members	of	the	Church
This	is	another	reason	why	prayer	is	so	important.	Any	pastor	and	church	leaders
and/or	church	members	who	are	really	taking	a	stand	for	the	Lord	and	against
Satan	will	come	under	tremendous	attack	by	witchcraft.
They	will	be	afflicted	with	all	sorts	of	physical	illness,	difficulties	in
concentrating,	confusion,	fatigue,	difficulties	in	praying,	etc.	The	leaders	of	any
church	must	be	continuously	upheld	in	prayer	and	interceeded	for	by	the
members	of	the	congregation.	Once	such	a	prayer	base	is	lost,	the	pastor	and
leaders	face	these	attacks	alone.	Often	they	are	overcome.	That	is	why	Paul
asked	his	fellow	Christians	to	pray	for	him	at	the	end	of	almost	every	letter	he
wrote.

The	incredible	number	of	powerless,	dead	Christian	churches	in	our	land	today
is	a	testimony	to	the	success	of	Satan’s	carefully	planned	tactics.	Our	prayer	is
that	every	Christian	reading	these	words	will	go	to	the	Lord	in	prayer	and	seek
guidance	as	to	how	to	fight	such	attacks	within	his	or	her	own	church.

CHAPTER	18
Demonic	Illnesses

REBECCA	TALKS:
The	issue	of	demonic	involvement	in	illnesses	afflicting	the	physical	human
body	is	a	much	debated	and	misunderstood	one.	I	am	not	trying	to	settle	any
debates	here	because	I	know	that	is	impossible.	I	wish	to	present	to	you,	the
reader,	some	scriptures	and	personal	experiences	as	a	physician	in	this	area,	and
share	with	you	what	the	Lord	has	taught	me	about	this	problem.
I	am	well	aware	that	some	church	leaders	teach	that	all	physical	illness	is	a
direct	result	of	demonic	infestation	and	that	the	only	route	to	healing	is	through
deliverance.	Others,	of	course	take	the	opposite	extreme	and	say	that	Christians
cannot	be	touched	by	demons.	Let	us	look	at	God’s	word.
I,	as	a	physician,	especially	enjoy	reading	the	gospel	of	Luke,	because	I	see	so
many	areas	where	Luke	brings	a	physician’s	view	point	to	his	writing.	He	is
careful	to	show	differences	in	the	areas	of	illnesses	where	others	did	not	have	the
same	awareness.
“And	he	[Jesus]	came	down	with	them,	and	stood	in	the	plain,	and	the
company	of	his	disciples,	and	a	great	multitude	of	people	out	of	all
Judaea	and	Jerusalem,	and	from	the	sea	coast	of	Tyre	and	Sidon,	which
came	to	hear	him,	and	to	be	healed	of	their	diseases;	and	they	that	were
vexed	with	unclean	spirits:	and	they	were	healed.”	Luke	6:17-18
Please	note	the	clear	distinction	made	here	that	some	of	the	illnesses	were
healed,	and	some	were	healed	as	a	result	of	the	unclean	spirits	being	cast	out.
“And	in	that	same	hour	he	[Jesus]	cured	many	of	their	infirmities	and
plagues,	and	of	evil	spirits;	and	unto	many	that	were	blind	he	gave	sight.”
Luke	7:21
Again,	the	same	distinction	is	made.	There	are	two	clear	cases	also	given	in
Luke	which	demonstrate	the	same	point	—	that	is,	some	diseases	are	purely
physical,	and	some	are	caused	by	demons.
“And	as	he	[Jesus]	was	yet	a	coming,	the	devil	threw	him	down,	and	tare
him.	And	Jesus	rebuked	the	unclean	spirit,	and	healed	the	child,	and
delivered	him	again	to	his	father.”	Luke	9:42	“And	he	[Jesus]	arose	out
of	the	synagogue,	and	entered	into	Simon’s	house.	And	Simon’s	wife’s
mother	was	taken	with	a	great	fever;	and	they	besought	him	for	her.	And

he	stood	over	her,	and	rebuked	the	fever;	and	it	left	her:	and	immediately
she	arose	and	ministered	unto	them.”	Luke	4:38-39
The	emphasized	portions	show	the	clear	difference.	In	the	first	case	Jesus	healed
by	rebuking	the	unclean	spirit,	in	the	second	He	healed	by	rebuking	the	physical
fever.
Demons	can,	and	do,	cause	illness.	Not	all	illness	is	demonic,	but	a	significant
amount	is.	We	must	remember	that	physical	as	well	as	spiritual	death	was	the
result	of	Adam’s	fall.	The	alteration	in	our	physical	bodies	caused	by	sin	makes
us	vulnerable	to	an	array	of	physical	illnesses.	The	Lord	has	taught	me	much	in
this	area.	Demons	are	expert	in	handling	bacteria	and	viruses	and	do	cause	much
illness	by	placing	these	into	human	bodies,	but	they	can	also	do	damage	directly.
Demons	tear	apart	a	physical	body	on	the	molecular	level.	They	do	this	in	such	a
way	that	devastating	damage	can	be	done	to	the	various	organs	without	altering
the	appearance	of	the	cellular	structures	under	our	microscopes.	The	damage
they	do	usually	requires	treatment	with	physical	medicines,	nutrition,	etc.,	but
the	physician	can	know	only	by	direct	revelation	from	the	Lord,	what	is	really
wrong	with	such	a	patient	and	what	treatment	to	use.	Few	Christian	physicians
are	willing	to	take	the	risk	of	depending	on	the	Lord	so	completely.	I	am	not
advocating	treating	a	patient	without	all	the	appropriate	diagnostic	tests,	but
every	physician,	whether	he	will	admit	it	or	not,	sees	an	uncomfortable	number
of	cases	in	which	all	the	diagnostics	do	not	give	the	answer	as	to	what	is	wrong
with	the	patient.	In	these	cases	it	is	the	responsibility	of	the	physician	to
specially	seek	the	Lord’s	guidance	with	fasting	and	prayer.
One	of	the	most	striking	illustrations	of	this	type	of	demonic	damage	was	a	case
that	happened	close	to	the	end	of	my	training.	I	was,	at	the	time,	the	internal
medicine	resident	in	charge	of	the	intensive	care	unit.	A	35	year	old	man,	Bob,
was	brought	into	the	unit	one	day	from	a	hospital	in	one	of	the	smaller	outlying
cities	close	by	where	he	had	been	hospitalized	for	a	week.	He	had	taken	ill
suddenly	and	was	running	extremely	high	fevers.	His	doctors	had	been	unable	to
find	the	cause.	As	I	examined	him	the	day	he	was	admitted,	I	could	not	find	any
specific	thing	wrong	either,	but	he	was	obviously	profoundly	ill.	As	we	started
the	usual	battery	of	tests,	and	asked	other	specialists	to	see	him	also,	I	started
praying	intensely	asking	the	Lord	to	reveal	to	me	what	was	wrong	with	him.
The	next	morning	he	suddenly	jumped	out	of	bed	declaring	that	he	was	going	to
leave	the	hospital	that	very	minute,	that	if	he	didn’t,	he	would	be	killed.	No
amount	of	talking	could	change	his	mind.	Finally	his	private	doctor	got	a	72
hour	restraining	order	from	the	court	to	keep	him	in	the	hospital.	When	the

hour	restraining	order	from	the	court	to	keep	him	in	the	hospital.	When	the
restraining	order	was	served	on	Bob	he	immediately	“flipped	out,”	and	lay	on
the	bed	staring	at	the	ceiling	muttering	incoherently,	unresponsive	to	any
stimulus.	He	remained	in	this	condition	over	the	next	2	days	while	his	physical
condition	rapidly	deteriorated.
Finally	on	the	third	morning	as	I	was	getting	ready	for	work,	Father	spoke	to	me
and	told	me	that	Bob	was	actually	a	high	priest	from	a	nearby	town.	His	illness
was	satanic	discipline	because	he	had	displeased	Satan	in	some	way.	Bob	had
wanted	to	leave	the	hospital	because	he	had	run	into	the	demonic	power	of
“David”	the	local	high	priest	who	was	a	physician	at	Memorial	Hospital.	Two
high	priests	never	get	into	the	same	territory,	except	by	mutual	agreement,
without	dueling	to	the	death.	Bob	knew	that	in	his	weakened	condition	that	he
did	not	stand	a	chance	against	David.	Father	told	me	to	go	and	bind	the	demons
of	Mind-binding	and	Confusion	and	then	tell	Bob	that	I	knew	who	he	was	and
what	was	going	on	and	share	the	gospel	with	him.	Fervently	hoping	that	I	had
heard	the	Lord	correctly,	I	went	to	do	His	bidding	that	morning.
As	I	entered	Bob’s	room	early	that	morning	I	made	sure	no	one	else	was	in	the
room	and	closed	his	door.	I	tried	to	see	if	I	could	get	him	to	respond	to	me,	but
was	unsuccessful.	He	continued	his	incoherent	muttering.	Then,	leaning	my
arms	on	the	rail	of	his	bed	I	said:
“You	demons	of	Mind-binding	and	Confusion,	my	master	Jesus	has	sent	me	to
bind	you,	and	I	now	do	so	in	the	name	of	Jesus	Christ.	You	may	no	longer	afflict
this	man.”
The	result	was	dramatic.	Instantly	Bob’s	muttering	stopped	and	he	turned	his
head	and	looked	at	me,	completely	lucid.	“Good	morning,”	he	said,	“did	you
want	something?”
“Yes,	I	have	a	message	for	you	from	the	God	most	high.”	I	went	on	to	tell	him
the	things	Father	had	told	me.	Then	I	briefly	shared	the	gospel	with	him.
“Bob,	you	must	realize	that	your	only	hope	is	Jesus.	Satan	is	determined	to	kill
you.	To	continue	to	serve	him	will	only	bring	destruction	to	you,	and	what	is
worse,	an	eternity	in	hell.”
He	looked	at	me	with	feigned	surprise.	“Who	are	you?!	You	are	crazy!	I	don’t
know	what	you	are	talking	about!”
“Oh	yes	you	do,	my	God	does	not	lie.”
“Oh	go	away,	I	want	nothing	to	do	with	Jesus!”

“Oh	go	away,	I	want	nothing	to	do	with	Jesus!”
“So	be	it.	That	is	your	choice.”
With	that,	I	left	his	room.	From	that	time	on	Bob	remained	completely	alert	and
oriented.	I	must	admit,	I	did	have	some	fun	pushing	the	specialists	that	morning,
asking	them	to	give	me	an	explanation	for	Bob’s	sudden	return	to	alertness	when
his	physical	condition	had	not	improved.	None	of	them	could	give	me	a
reasonable	explanation.
I	continued	to	fast	and	pray	intensely	for	Bob,	asking	Father	to	give	him	at	least
one	more	chance.	Four	days	later	Bob	was	very	near	death.	His	kidneys	had
stopped	working	two	days	before,	his	liver	was	hardly	working	at	all,	he	was	in
heart	failure	and	his	lungs	were	filling	up	with	water.	His	blood	pressure	was	so
low	that	he	was	on	medication	in	his	LV.	(intravenous)	to	try	to	maintain	his
blood	pressure	at	a	reasonable	level.	I	knew	that	within	a	very	short	time	he
would	have	to	be	put	on	a	machine	to	breath	for	him.	He	had	pain	continuously
that	we	could	not	control.	Then	Father	spoke	to	me	again,	telling	me	to	go	once
more	and	share	the	gospel	with	Bob.
As	before,	I	made	sure	I	was	alone	in	his	room.	“Bob,	you	are	dying!	Don’t	you
realize	that?	Don’t	you	think	maybe	it’s	time	to	be	honest	with	me?”
“Yes,	perhaps	you	are	right.”
“Do	you	remember	our	conversation	four	days	ago?”
“Yes,	very	well.	You	were	right,	I	am	a	high	priest,	and	I	did	want	to	leave
because	I	knew	David	would	kill	me.”
“Bob,	you	must	see	that	your	only	hope	is	Jesus.	Won’t	you	ask	Him	to	forgive
you	and	to	become	your	master	instead	of	Satan?”
“Yes,	but	I	don’t	think	I	would	be	permitted	to	do	so.”
“Why?”
“Because	of	Satan	standing	there.”	He	motioned	with	his	hand	to	the	opposite
side	of	the	bed	from	which	I	was	standing.	I	could	not	see	anything,	but	my	spirit
sensed	his	presence.
“No,	the	Lord	has	bound	him.	Do	you	need	a	sign	that	this	is	so?”	(The	Lord	had
told	me	I	could	cast	out	the	demon	of	pain	as	a	sign	that	what	I	was	saying	was
true.	The	casting	out	of	this	demon	would	have	brought	immediate	relief	from
his	pain.)
“No,	just	the	fact	that	you	are	crazy	enough	to	take	the	chances	you	are	by

“No,	just	the	fact	that	you	are	crazy	enough	to	take	the	chances	you	are	by
coming	in	here	like	this	is	enough	to	show	me.”
Then,	with	tears	streaming	down	his	face	he	took	my	hand	and	with	a	quavering
voice	asked	Jesus	to	forgive	him	and	to	be	his	master.	Then	he	turned	toward	the
other	side	of	the	bed	and	addressed	Satan	directly	and	told	him	that	he	would	no
longer	serve	him,	no	matter	what	happened.
At	the	Lord’s	direction	I	cast	out	several	demons	responsible	for	his	fever,	pain,
kidney	failure,	etc.	His	pain	stopped	immediately	and	he	was	pain	free	for	the
first	time	in	many	days.	Within	two	hours	he	was	off	the	medicine	for	his	blood
pressure.	Within	two	days	he	was	out	of	the	intensive	care	unit	and	within	less
than	two	weeks	he	was	discharged	from	the	hospital	completely	well!	(The
specialists	attributed	his	illness	to	a	“virus.”	That	is	a	diagnosis	often	used	when
no	one	really	knows	what	the	problem	is.)
I	sometimes	wonder	how	many	patients	I	have	seen	in	the	past	who	have	died	of
devastating	illnesses	without	ever	really	being	diagnosed.	Usually	such	cases	are
attributed	to	a	“virus.”	Christian	physicians	should	earnestly,	with	much	prayer
and	fasting	seek	the	Lord’s	guidance	and	revelation	about	such	cases.	Also,
James	chapter	5	is	too	often	overlooked	by	both	churches	and	doctors.	Often	the
only	way	demonic	wounds	and	illnesses	can	be	healed	is	by	prayer	in	faith	and
anointing	with	oil.
Another	common	way	demons	afflict	the	physical	bodies	of	human	beings	is
with	pain.	Pain	that	varies	in	severity	but	usually	is	devastating	and	for	which	no
cause	can	be	found	medically.	Any	time	I	see	a	patient	who	is	experiencing
significant	pain	for	which	I	can	not	find	a	physical	cause,	I	immediately	begin	to
seek	the	Lord	for	a	revelation	as	to	the	source.	It	is	usually	demonic.	When
satanists	fight	with	their	witchcraft	powers	the	loser	frequently	ends	up	in	the
emergency	room	of	some	hospital	with	severe	pain	for	which	no	cause	can	be
found.	Demons	do	not	always	inflict	physical	damage	at	the	same	time	as	they
cause	pain,	and	they	do	not	have	to	be	inside	the	body	to	cause	pain.
Often	Christians	are	also	afflicted	with	this	type	of	pain.	Usually	they	have	no
idea	that	the	problem	is	demonic,	or	where	the	demons	came	from.	Demons	sent
by	witches	usually	afflict	a	person	from	outside	their	body	—	especially	born
again	believers.	Also,	human	spirits	(as	described	in	figure	F	of	chapter	14)	can
afflict	from	without	just	as	demons	do,	although	demons	are	usually	the	cause
except	when	the	doorway	of	hatred	is	involved.	I	have	seen	a	number	of	cases
where	the	patient’s	affliction	was	the	result	of	hatred	directed	toward	them	by
another	person.	In	these	cases	a	simple	anointing	with	oil	and	prayer	by	the

another	person.	In	these	cases	a	simple	anointing	with	oil	and	prayer	by	the
afflicted	person	asking	the	Lord	to	shield	them	from	any	hatred	directed	toward
them	has	been	effective	when	all	other	measures	failed.
A	good	example	of	such	pain	is	the	case	of	a	young	man	in	his	mid-thirties
whom	I	will	call	John.	John	came	to	the	emergency	room	one	night	complaining
of	very	severe	chest	pain	typical	of	the	pain	involved	in	a	heart	attack.	I	admitted
him	to	the	hospital	and	ran	many	tests	—	all	of	which	turned	out	normal.	Two
weeks	after	his	discharge	he	came	to	my	office	one	evening	in	obvious	agony
with	the	same	pain.	I	suspected	that	he	was	a	satanist	receiving	the	worst	end	of
a	fight,	but	did	not	at	that	point	have	a	clear	revelation	from	the	Lord.	As	I	had
already	run	all	the	tests	available	to	me	at	the	hospital	in	which	I	practiced,	I	sent
him	to	a	large	city	nearby	to	be	further	evaluated	by	cardiologists	there.	They
admitted	him	to	the	hospital	there	and	ran	further	tests.	They	also	did	what	is
called	a	cardiac	catheterization	where	dye	is	injected	into	the	arteries	of	the	heart
to	see	if	there	is	any	blockage	to	the	blood	flow	there.	Again,	all	was	normal.
When	John	returned	to	see	me	after	this	complete	evaluation,	he	was	most
discouraged	because	he	was	still	incapacitated	with	frequent	episodes	of	the
chest	pain.	With	the	Lord’s	guidance,	I	sat	down	and	talked	with	him	and
challenged	him	directly	with	the	fact	that	I	thought	he	was	a	satanist	and	that	his
chest	pain	was	the	result	of	demonic	fighting	between	himself	and	someone	else.
He	was	shocked.	So	shocked,	in	fact,	that	he	didn’t	even	bother	trying	to	deny
that	what	I	said	was	true.	I	talked	with	him	extensively,	sharing	the	gospel	with
him	and	telling	him	that	his	only	hope	was	Jesus	Christ.	Unfortunately,	this
young	man	wanted	power	at	any	price.	Despite	everything	that	had	happened	to
him	he	was	still	determined	to	stay	in	Satanism.	He	acknowledged	that	he	knew
his	pain	was	caused	by	demonic	fighting.	Finally,	he	moved	out	of	state	to	get
away	from	the	other	stronger	satanist	and	to	establish	himself	in	a	new	coven	to
try	to	grow	in	power	there.	I	often	pray	for	that	young	man	and	wonder	what
happened	to	him.	How	sad	to	see	such	a	life	wasted	because	of	the	lust	for
power!
The	various	types	of	emotional	problems	that	can	be	caused	by	demons	are
endless.	But	again,	we	cannot	assume	that	ALL	emotional	disorders	are	demonic
in	origin.	I	have	seen	some	very	sad	cases	of	Christians	who	have	been	greatly
damaged	by	others	telling	them	their	problem	was	demonic,	when	they	were
having	a	purely	natural	human	reaction	to	the	stress	in	their	lives.	Let	us	never
forget	that	we	ARE	human	beings,	once	we	become	Christians	we	do	not
become	some	sort	of	super-being	no	longer	susceptible	to	weaknesses	and
reactions	to	stress.

I	think	we	should	discuss	here	one	of	the	most	common	problems	afflicting	the
human	race	—	DEPRESSION.	Much	is	written	about	depression	in	the	Bible.
“Why	art	thou	cast	down,	O	my	soul?	and	why	art	thou	disquieted	in	me?
hope	thou	in	God:	for	I	shall	yet	praise	him	for	the	help	of	his
countenance.	O	my	God,	my	soul	is	cast	down	within	me:	therefore	will	I
remember	thee	from	the	land	of	Jordan,	and	of	the	Hermonites,	from	the
hill	Mizar.”	Psalm	42:5-6
There	are	a	multitude	of	references	in	the	Psalms	and	other	places	to	depression.
This	battle	is	real,	and	we	are	very	human!	I	am	so	thankful	that	the	Lord
included	such	scriptures	in	the	Bible.	Look	at	the	following	verses:
“Awake,	why	sleepest	thou,	O	Lord?	arise,	cast	us	not	off	for	ever.
Wherefore	hidest	thou	thy	face,	and	forgettest	our	affliction	and	our
oppression?	For	our	soul	is	bowed	down	to	the	dust:	our	belly	cleaveth
unto	the	earth.”	Psalm	44:23-25
If	any	true	born-again	believer	tries	to	tell	me	that	he	has	never	felt	the	emotions
expressed	in	the	above	two	sections	quoted,	I	would	have	to	say	that	either	he
has	never	taken	a	stand	for	the	Lord	and	thus	become	involved	in	spiritual
warfare,	or	he	is	lying!
Look	at	the	great	honesty	with	which	Paul	the	apostle	wrote:
“For	we	would	not,	brethren,	have	you	ignorant
of	our	trouble	which	came	to	us	in	Asia,	that	we
were	pressed	out	of	measure,	above	strength,
insomuch	that	we	despaired	even	of	life:	But	we
had	the	sentence	of	death	in	ourselves,	that	we
should	not	trust	in	ourselves,	but	in	God	which
raiseth	the	dead.”
II	Corinthians	1:8-9
There	are	many,	many	causes	of	depression.	Unfortunately,	too	many	people
involved	in	deliverance	ministries	say	that	all	depression	is	demonic.	I	think	this
is	because	we	humans	always	are	looking	for	the	easy	way	out	of	any	situation.
If	all	depression	is	demonic	in	origin	the	solution	is	simple,	cast	out	the	demon
and	presto,	the	depression	is	gone!	It	has	been	my	experience	that	the	majority	of
cases	of	serious	depression	that	I	have	seen	have	not	been	the	result	of	a	demon

of	depression	indwelling	the	person.
The	most	frequent	cause	of	serious	depression	that	I	have	seen	is	a	direct	result
of	an	almost	complete	lack	of	mind	control.	(Please	see	a	more	detailed
discussion	of	mind	control	in	Chapter	16.)	God’s	word	clearly	tells	us	that	we
are	to	take	captive	every	thought	to	make	it	obedient	to	Christ.	(II	Cor.	3:5.)
Seriously	depressed	people	(including	Christians)	almost	never	obey	this	direct
command	from	the	Lord.	They	allow	any	thought	to	stay	in	their	mind	which
Satan	and/or	his	demons	chose	to	put	there.	They	never	stop	to	evaluate	how
accurate	their	thoughts	are	with	the	reality	of	their	situation,	or	with	the	situation
in	the	light	of	God’s	word.	They	accept	all	thoughts	as	being	from	themselves,	in
short,	they	are	lazy!	They	have	allowed	their	minds	to	slip	into	lazy	passivity
and	in	such	a	state	they	come	under	tremendous	emotional	torment	by	demonic
forces.
The	fight	to	regain	control	of	your	mind	is	one	of	the	most	difficult	battles	you
will	ever	engage	in,	but	it	will	be	well	worth	the	effort.	I	saw	many	cases	of
depression	in	my	medical	practice	because	word	quickly	spread	that	I	was	a
Christian	physician.	I	can	say	that	in	every	case	of	depression	I	saw,	except	the
few	that	were	a	direct	result	of	demonic	infestation,	dramatically	improved	with
the	institution	of	the	steps	toward	mind	control	listed	in	chapter	15.	Please	note
how	David	was	doing	this	in	Psalm	42	where	he	says	“	...	I	will	yet	praise	the
Lord	...	”	He	was	using	his	will	to	overcome	the	depressive	thoughts	in	his	soul
(mind)	and	declaring	that	he	would	praise	the	Lord.	Praise	plays	a	very
important	part	in	overcoming	depression.	Please	note	my	own	experience	as
described	near	the	end	of	Chapter	14.
Other	common	sources	of	depression	are	a	major	loss,	such	as	of	a	loved	one,
physical	illness	and	weakness,	big	adverse	changes	in	life	circumstances	and,	of
course,	from	pure	exhaustion	—	especially	in	people	involved	in	spiritual
warfare.	Those	of	us	involved	in	spiritual	warfare	need	to	be	continually
sensitive	and	obedient	to	the	Lord’s	leading	in	this	area.	When	the	Lord
commands	you	to	stop	and	rest	you	had	better	obey	no	matter	how	unnecessary
you	may	think	the	request	at	the	moment,	or	you	will	no	doubt	get	shot	down
quickly.	By	this	I	mean,	you	will	suffer	either	serious	physical	or	emotional
difficulties,	(especially	in	the	area	of	relationships	with	other	people)	or	you	may
fall	into	error	and	be	deceived	because	you	can	no	longer	be	as	alert	as	you	need
to	be.	Too	many	people	forget	that	they	are	still	human	with	human	weaknesses
and	limitations.	If	we	let	the	Lord	guide	us	in	these	areas	we	will	avoid	much
difficulty.
Some	of	the	most	powerful	demons	I	have	ever	encountered	have	come	into	a

Some	of	the	most	powerful	demons	I	have	ever	encountered	have	come	into	a
person	as	a	result	of	incest	within	a	family	and	the	various	sexual	perversions	—
especially	sadomasochism	which	has	become	so	popular	today	through	heavy
metal	Rock	music.
These	powerful	demons	often	are	of	a	class	of	demons	that	are	able	to	inhabit	all
three	areas	of	the	human	at	once	—	body	and	soul	and	spirit.	Let	me	give	you	an
example	of	this.
I	received	a	call	one	afternoon	at	my	office	from	a	minister	in	a	nearby	city.	He
asked	if	I	was	“The	doctor	involved	in	a	deliverance	ministry.”	On	receiving	my
affirmative	reply,	he	said	that	he	had	a	young	woman	that	must	be	seen	that	day.
I	agreed	and	they	came	at	the	end	of	my	office	hours	that	evening.
Jane	(not	her	real	name)	was	a	25	year	old	young	woman	who	had	been	married
two	years.	Her	husband	was	a	very	intelligent	young	man	slightly	older.	Both
had	committed	their	lives	to	Jesus	about	a	year	prior	to	their	marriage	and	had
attended	this	church	regularly.	They	had	been	involved	in	counseling	with	the
minister	and	assistant	pastor	because	Jane	was	completely	frigid.	They	had	not
been	able	to	consummate	their	marriage.
Three	days	prior	to	coming	to	me	the	pastor	and	some	other	members	of	the
church	had	correctly	discerned	that	the	problem	was	demonic	and	had	attempted
to	deliver	her.	They	had	been	unsuccessful,	and	as	a	result,	for	the	48	hours	prior
to	coming	to	me,	Jane	had	completely	lost	her	mental	function.	She	babbled
nonsense	constantly,	could	not	control	her	bodily	functions	or	eat	or	drink.	She
did	not	know	who	she	was	or	where	she	was.
They	were	all	very	frightened	because	her	husband	had	received	a	call	from	her
very	domineering	parents	that	day	and	was	told	that	they	were	coming	up	the
next	day	to	take	Jane	home	with	them	and	“	...	put	her	in	a	mental	hospital	where
she	belonged.”	Placement	on	a	psychiatric	ward	was	the	last	thing	Jane	needed	at
that	point.	Treatment	with	all	sorts	of	strong	drugs	and	possibly	electroshock
therapy	would	have	only	caused	more	harm.	What	a	mess!	The	legal
implications	of	the	situation	were	stupendous	and	my	overwhelming	desire	was
to	tell	them	all	to	leave!	But,	I	was	impressed	that	her	husband	had	been
committed	enough	to	remain	in	an	unconsummated	marriage	for	over	two	years
and	I	could	see	that	he	was	desperate.	So	I	told	them	I	needed	20	minutes	or	so
to	seek	the	Lord’s	will	as	to	what	I	should	do.
I	went	upstairs	by	myself	and	fell	on	my	knees	before	Father	to	earnestly	seek
His	will	in	prayer.	Almost	immediately	He	gave	me	a	complete	peace	that	He
was	willing	to	deliver	Jane.	Then	He	revealed	to	me	that	Jane	was	possessed	by

was	willing	to	deliver	Jane.	Then	He	revealed	to	me	that	Jane	was	possessed	by
one	of	the	powerful	demons	that	inhabit	all	three	areas	of	a	human	being	at	once.
These	people	had	not	realized	this	and	therefore	had	been	unsuccessful	in	their
attempts	to	deliver	Jane.	They	had	stirred	up	the	demon	and	he	was	methodically
proceeding	to	kill	her	before	she	could	be	delivered.	The	Lord	opened	my
spiritual	eyes	and	let	me	see	what	was	going	on	in	her	body.	Her	brain	was
ripped	and	torn	as	if	something	with	huge	claws	had	attempted	to	shred	it.	Other
areas	of	her	body	were	in	the	same	condition.	The	Lord	instructed	me	to	anoint
Jane	with	oil	and	hold	my	hands	on	her	head	and	pray	until	He	had	delivered
her.	He	also	specifically	instructed	me	that	in	this	particular	case	that	I	was	not
to	permit	any	of	the	others	to	touch	her.
When	I	returned	to	my	office	I	tried	to	explain	to	them	the	characteristics	of	the
demon	and	why	they	had	been	unable	to	cast	it	out.	Then	I	proceeded	as	the
Lord	had	instructed,	sitting	on	the	arm	of	Jane’s	chair,	hands	on	her	head.
Immediately	the	battle	was	on.	First	I	had	to	gain	control	of	the	rather	minor
demon	that	was	babbling	through	her	mouth	continuously	and	causing	her	to	be
so	restless.	As	soon	as	the	Lord	took	him	out	Jane	became	quiet.	She	was	still
completely	confused,	however.	Several	other	minor	demons	tried	to	obstruct	and
move	Jane	away	from	me,	but	they	were	quickly	cast	out.	The	last	one	went	out
screaming:
“You	think	you’re	so	smart,	you’ll	never	get	Yurashuha	out!	He’s	too	strong	and
he’s	been	there	too	long!”
“How	did	Yurashuha	get	in?”	I	asked	curtly.	The	demon	laughed,	“That’s	easy
stupid,	he	came	in	while	her	father	had	sex	with	her	when	she	was	a	child.”	The
Lord	had	previously	revealed	to	me	that	that	was	the	doorway	through	which
this	powerful	demon	had	entered	Jane.
It	is	well	known	in	medical	circles	that	traumatic	sexual	assaults	in	childhood	is
one	of	the	most	common	causes	of	frigidity	in	women	in	later	life	—	especially
incest.	We	were	taught	in	our	courses	in	psychiatry	in	medical	school	that	the
percentage	of	these	women	ever	successfully	helped	is	dreadfully	low.
After	about	20	minutes	or	so,	the	pastor	and	the	others	with	him	left	saying	they
could	not	spare	any	more	time.	I	must	admit	I	was	rather	relieved.	It	was	a
memorable	experience	for	me.	As	I	sat	there,	hands	on	Jane’s	head,	praying	and
praising	the	Lord,	I	felt	His	power	being	channeled	through	me	and	flowing
down	my	arms	and	hands.	I	became	so	hot,	especially	my	arms	and	hands,	that	I
was	very	uncomfortable.	Afterwards	Jane	complained	that	my	hands	were	so	hot
that	they	had	burned	her	head	and	she	had	what	looked	like	almost	first	degree
burns	on	her	scalp.	These	disappeared	in	an	hour	or	so.	The	battle	raged	and	I

burns	on	her	scalp.	These	disappeared	in	an	hour	or	so.	The	battle	raged	and	I
held	that	position	for	a	little	over	two	hours.	As	always,	the	Lord	was	faithful,
and	at	last	the	demon	lost	his	hold	and	came	out	screaming	profanities.
Immediately	when	the	demon	was	out	a	great	change	came	over	Jane,	she
became	almost	completely	alert	and	oriented	again.	A	slight	amount	of
intermittent	confusion	remained	and	because	of	this	her	husband	was	doubtful
that	she	was	completely	delivered.	I	explained	to	him	about	the	damage	that	had
been	done,	telling	him	that	it	would	take	some	time	to	heal	all	of	the	physical
damage.	I	did	go	ahead	and	do	a	bunch	of	medical	tests	over	the	next	few	days
both	for	their	peace	of	mind,	and	to	be	sure	I	wasn’t	missing	anything.	Each	day
saw	a	big	improvement	in	Jane’s	condition.	All	the	tests	came	back	normal	just
as	I	had	expected.	It	took	about	a	month	for	Jane’s	complete	recovery.	The	last	I
saw	them	was	about	three	months	after	Jane’s	deliverance.	They	were	very
happy	and	Jane’s	husband	joyfully	told	me	they	were	now	having	a	normal
sexual	relationship	and	that	Jane	was	expecting	their	first	child.	I	cannot	thank
the	Lord	enough	for	His	tremendous	work	in	the	lives	of	that	young	couple!
Satan’s	kingdom	is	vast	beyond	our	comprehension.	We	must	daily	walk	in
complete	dependence	on	the	Lord	for	wisdom	and	guidance.	No	two	people	are
alike,	and	every	attack	by	Satan	is	different.	We	are	not	smart	enough	to	begin	to
figure	out	Satan’s	deceptions	on	our	own.	It	is	continually	my	prayer	that	the
Lord	will	give	us	wisdom	because	this	battle	is	real	and	if	we	are	not	in	touch
with	our	“Captain,”	we	can	cause	great	harm	to	those	we	are	trying	to	help.
Jane’s	case	brings	me	to	a	point	that,	sadly,	many	deliverance	ministers	tend	to
forget.	Isaiah	chapter	42	says	it	best	in	the	prophetic	description	of	Jesus:
“Behold	my	servant,	whom	I	uphold;	mine
elect,	in	whom	my	soul	delighteth;	I	have	put
my	spirit	upon	him:	he	shall	bring	forth
judgment	to	the	Gentiles.	He	shall	not	cry,	nor
lift	up,	nor	cause	his	voice	to	be	heard	in	the
street.	A	bruised	reed	shall	he	not	break,	and	the
smoking	flax	shall	he	not	quench:	he	shall	bring
forth	judgment	unto	truth.	He	shall	not	fail	nor
be	discouraged,	till	he	have	set	judgment	in	the
earth:	and	the	isles	shall	wait	for	his	law.”	Isaiah
42:1-4	“My	little	children,	let	us	not	love	in
word,	neither	in	tongue;	but	in	deed	and	in

word,	neither	in	tongue;	but	in	deed	and	in
truth.”	I	John	3:18
I	have	seen	many,	many	people	remain	undelivered	or	only	partially	delivered
because	of	the	lack	of	love	on	the	part	of	the	deliverance	ministers.	I	challenge
everyone	in	any	way	involved	in	a	deliverance	ministry.	Just	how	much	do	you
love	the	person	you	are	trying	to	deliver??	Do	you	love	them	enough	to	sit
patiently	and	work	patiently	for	several	hours	at	a	time,	perhaps	in	more	than
one	session	in	order	to	see	them	delivered?
Do	you	love	them	enough	to	take	them	into	your	own	home	for	a	time	if
necessary	to	continue	the	battle?	Do	you	love	them	enough	to	take	the	time	and
effort	to	take	them	to	a	private	place	for	deliverance	to	avoid	embarrassment	for
them?	Do	you	men	have	enough	love	to	sink	your	pride	and	leave	the	room
when	it	comes	time	to	deal	with	certain	sexual	demons	in	a	woman	and	let	just
women	do	the	deliverance	in	that	case?	Also	vise	versa	for	men.	Or	would	your
pride	prevent	you	from	even	hearing	such	a	request	from	the	Lord?
Jesus	would	not	break	a	bruised	reed.	Love	always	protects.
Why	then	should	you	not	think	about	and	seek	in	every	way	possible	to	protect	a
person	being	delivered	from	the	often	intense	embarrassment	involved?	They
have	trauma	enough	without	adding	to	it.	Deliverance	of	the	deeper	and	more
powerful	demons	is	usually	not	something	that	can	be	accomplished	in	5-10
minutes	up	at	the	altar	in	front	of	the	whole	church,	or	in	front	of	TV	cameras.
Our	God	is	a	God	of	love	and	compassion.	If	you	do	not	have	His	love	and
compassion	for	every	person	you	deal	with	then	you	are	not	fit	for	a	deliverance
ministry.	If	you	are	“too	busy”	to	take	time	with	individuals,	then	you	should	not
attempt	to	be	involved	in	a	deliverance	ministry.
The	same	principles	apply	in	the	area	of	healing	whether	the	source	of	the	illness
is	demonic	or	purely	physical.	James	chapter	5	and	Mark	chapter	16	do	not	give
time	limits.
“And	these	signs	shall	follow	them	that	believe	...	they	shall	lay	hands	on
the	sick,	and	they	shall	recover.”	Mark	16:17-18
“Is	any	sick	among	you?	Let	him	call	for	the	elders	of	the	church;	and	let
them	pray	over	him,	anointing	him	with	oil	in	the	name	of	the	Lord:	And
the	prayer	of	faith	shall	save	the	sick,	and	the	Lord	shall	raise	him	up...”
James	5:14-15
Why	are	we	humans	always	in	a	hurry?	Why	do	we	usually	think	God	works	in	a

hurry?	Does	not	the	Bible	itself	from	cover	to	cover	demonstrate	to	us	that	God
never	hurries?	I	will	tell	you	plainly	why	we	are	always	in	a	hurry	—
selfishness.	Our	time	is	the	last	thing	we	want	to	give	up.	How	many	people	go
forward	to	the	altar	in	faith,	asking	the	elders	to	pray	for	their	healing	and	are	not
healed?	We	would	be	staggered	if	we	knew	the	percentage,	but	the	world’s	low
regard	for	the	church	should	give	us	a	good	indication.	In	Acts	we	find	that	the
world	regarded	the	church	very	differently	then	they	do	now:
“And	great	fear	came	upon	all	the	church,	and	upon	as	many	as	heard
these	things.	And	by	the	hands	of	the	apostles	were	many	signs	and
wonders	wrought	among
the	people;	(and	they	were	all	with	one	accord
in	Solomon’s	porch).	And	of	the	rest	durst	no
man	join	himself	to	them:	but	the	people
magnified	them.”
Acts	5:11-13
Elders,	are	you	willing	to	tarry	in	love	and	in	prayer	30	minutes,	an	hour,	two
hours,	if	necessary	in	order	that	someone	can	be	healed?	God	is	so	powerful	He
can	heal	instantly	and	sometimes	does.	But	often,	because	of	His	great	love	and
compassion	He	does	not	do	so	because	of	the	pain	and	trauma	that	would	be
caused	by	so	much	cellular	rearrangement	in	a	short	time.	How	many	people	go
unhealed	because	the	elder	praying	for	them	is	so	selfish	with	his	time	that	he	is
unwilling	to	tarry	in	prayer	while	the	Lord	works?
“And	Jesus	rebuked	the	devil;	and	he	departed
out	of	him:	and	the	child	was	cured	from	that
very	hour.	Then	came	the	disciples	to	Jesus
apart,	and	said,	Why	could	not	we	cast	him	out?
Jesus	said	unto	them	...	this	kind	goeth	not	out
but	by	prayer	and	fasting.”
Matthew	17:18-19	&	21
Does	not	much	prayer	and	fasting	take	both	time	and	love?	God	does	not	choose
to	heal	or	deliver	in	the	same	way	everytime.	If	He	did,	we	would	soon	depend
upon	the	method	rather	than	upon	God.	If	we	are	selfish	in	the	area	of	time,	we

upon	the	method	rather	than	upon	God.	If	we	are	selfish	in	the	area	of	time,	we
will	not	be	able	to	discern	the	Lord’s	guidance	in	this	area.	God’s	work	must	be
done	in	God’s	time,	not	ours!
There	is	another	area	regarding	healing	that	few	are	willing	to	discuss,	let	alone
put	into	practice	in	a	practical	way.	Let	us	look	at	Isaiah:
“Is	not	this	the	fast	that	I	have	chosen?	to	loose	the	bands	of	wickedness,
to	undo	the	heavy	burdens,	and	to	let	the	oppressed	go	free,	and	that	ye
break	every	yoke?	Is	it	not	to	deal	thy	bread	to	the	hungry,	and	that	thou
bring	the	poor	that	are	cast	out	to	thy	house?	when	thou	seest	the	naked,
that	thou	cover	them;	and	that	thou	hide	not	thyself	from	thine	own
flesh?	Then	shall	thy	light	break	forth	as	the	morning,	and	thine
health	shall	spring	forth	speedily:	and	thy	righteousness	shall	go	before
thee;	the	glory	of	the	Lord	shall	be	thy	reward.”	Isaiah	58:6-8
“Bear	ye	one	another’s	burdens,	and	so	fulfill	the	law	of	Christ.”
Galatians	6:2
In	light	of	these	scriptures	and	others,	I	am	absolutely	convinced	that	the	reason
why	there	are	so	few	miraculous	healings	in	the	Christian	church	today	is
because	of	the	selfish	refusal	by	God’s	people	to	bear	one	another’s	burdens.
“This	is	my	commandment,	that	ye	love	one
another,	as	I	have	loved	you.	Greater	love	hath
no	man	than	this,	that	a	man	lay	down	his	life
for	his	friends.”
John	15:	12-13
Did	you	ever	stop	to	wonder	just	how	you	could	lay	down	your	life	for	a	brother
or	sister	other	than	going	out	and	stepping	in	front	of	a	gun	to	get	shot	instead	of
him?	There	are	many	other	ways!	Look	at	all	the	ways	God	lists	in	Isaiah	58:6-8
quoted	above.	What	about	bringing	someone	into	your	house	to	live	with	you?
That	really	hits!	People	like	to	keep	the	privacy	of	their	homes.	Our	homes
belong	to	God	and	are	for	His	use.	This	means	that	we	no	longer	have	any	right
to	our	“privacy”	because	there	are	people	out	there	who	need	to	be	brought	into
our	homes.	Very	few	Christians	ever	hear	the	Lord’s	request	asking	them	to	take
someone	into	their	home	because	they	are	so	selfish	in	this	area.
Are	you	willing,	when	a	brother	is	sick	to	say	“Lord	let	me	share	my	brother’s

burden,	let	me	literally	have	some	of	his	weakness	and/or	pain	so	that	you	can
heal	him	more	quickly.”	Yes	we	pray	for	healing	and	God	heals,	Yes	we	rebuke
Satan,	but	are	we	also	willing	to	share	the	burden?	You	see,	dear	ones,	I	think
that	this	is	how	we	can	lay	down	our	lives	for	each	other	and	I	think	that	as	we
do	this,	then	God	will	be	set	free	to	do	many	more	miraculous	healings.	In	Isaiah
58	the	Lord	tells	us	that	when	we	do	these	things	that	“...	thine	health	shall
spring	forth	speedily	...	”	(verse	8).	God	certainly	has	all	power	in	heaven	and	on
earth!	He	has	the	power	to	heal	and	raise	the	dead	in	every	case,	but	I	firmly
believe	that	in	many	cases	He	is	hindered	from	acting	freely	because	of	our
selfish	unwillingness	to	share	one	another’s	burdens	and	“so	fulfill	the	law	of
Christ.”	(Gal.	6:2)
Not	long	ago	a	brother	in	Christ	with	whom	I	work	daily,	injured	his	back.	The
injury	was	so	severe	that	he	was	ordered	to	stay	completely	down	in	bed	by	his
doctor.	I	knew	that	he	was	greatly	needed	at	work	and	as	I	prayed	for	his	healing
I	told	the	Lord	that	if	it	was	within	His	will	,	I	was	willing	to	share	my	brother’s
back	injury.	I	forgot	all	about	my	prayer	as	I	became	engrossed	in	the	activities
of	the	day.
Later	that	day	as	I	started	to	jump	up	from	a	chair,	in	a	hurry	as	usual,	I	fell	back
in	surprise.	My	back	was	so	painful	that	I	could	hardly	move!	Immediately	I
asked	the	Lord	what	had	happened	and	He	quickly	reminded	me	of	my	prayer
that	morning.	The	Lord	was	allowing	me	to	share	in	my	brother’s	injury.	That
evening	this	brother	called	into	work	rejoicing	that	he	was	able	to	be	up	on	his
feet,	although	he	still	had	pain.
Over	the	next	five	days	the	Lord	completely	healed	his	back,	much	to	his
doctor’s	astonishment.	Let	me	tell	you,	not	once	during	those	five	days	did	I
forget	to	pray	for	my	brother!	Everytime	I	tried	to	move	I	remembered	to	pray
because	of	the	pain	I	was	sharing.	I	also	became	completely	pain	free	as	the	Lord
healed	my	brother.	This	is	a	practical	example	of	what	I	am	talking	about.	I
know	from	my	medical	training	that	healing	can	be	a	painful	process.	I	believe
that	often	the	Lord	must	slow	down	the	healing	process	because	of	the	pain	it
involves.	If	we	are	willing	to	share,	the	healing	can	be	accomplished	much	more
quickly.
This	warfare	is	real	and	the	wounds	are	real.	We’ve	got	to	be	willing	to	help	one
another.	When	someone	is	speaking	or	someone	is	in	deliverance,	let	someone
else	sit	back	and	say	“Lord	let	me	share	that	person’s	burden.”
Let	me	give	you	an	example.	I	had	a	beautiful	dear	young	woman	come	to	my
house	a	couple	of	months	ago	with	whom	I	spoke	at	length.	She	had	been

house	a	couple	of	months	ago	with	whom	I	spoke	at	length.	She	had	been
involved	in	witchcraft	and	had	come	out	and	had	been	completely	delivered.	She
has	what	I	call	a	“gentle	heart.”	She	is	a	very	gentle	loving	person.	Because	of
her	involvement	in	witchcraft,	Satan	is	going	to	hammer	her	the	rest	of	her	life.
This	is	the	way	it	is	with	everyone	who	has	once	served	Satan	in	such	a	way	—
this	is	real	life.	This	young	woman	was	being	terribly	battered	and	she	is	not	a
physically	strong	person.	She	is	strong	in	the	Lord,	but	she	is	in	personality	a
gentle	person.	She	has	so	much	gentle	love	in	her	heart	for	other	people.
Now	some	people	are	just	naturally	more	a	fighter	than	others.	God	has	such	a
range	of	ministries.	This	young	woman	is	not	by	nature	a	fighter	and	she	is
having	to	spend	all	of	her	time	and	energy	just	“hanging	in	there”	against	the
demonic	attacks.	This	young	woman	was	created	to	be	a	minister	of	gentleness
and	love,	not	a	fighter.
I	was	so	upset	after	talking	with	her,	my	heart	just	broke	and	I	went	before	God
the	Father	in	tears	about	her,	and	asked	“Father,	WHY?	People	with	gentle
hearts	like	this	are	so	rare	and	their	love	is	so	needed	amongst	your	people,	why
does	she	have	to	spend	all	her	time	and	energy	battling?”	His	answer	was
“Because	my	people	are	unwilling	to	share	her	burdens.”	If	the	people	in	her
church	were	willing	to	share	her	burden	she	would	be	set	free	to	minister
gentleness	and	love	because	she	wouldn’t	have	to	fight	so	much.	Those	who	God
has	raised	up	with	the	personalities	and	strength	to	fight	would	be	fighting	the
battles	for	her	and	she	in	turn	would	be	ministering	with	the	gifts	God	has	given
her	and	there	would	be	a	sharing	and	great	blessing	for	all.	Then	pretty	soon
Satan	wouldn’t	be	attacking	her	so	hard	any	more	because	he	would	find	out	that
such	attacks	were	useless.	It’s	not	that	she	doesn’t	have	the	power	of	Christ	to
withstand	these	attacks,	she	does,	but	we	need	to	share.
This	is	a	wear-and-tear	warfare!	Let	us	learn	to	share	each	other’s	burdens,	this
is	what	being	part	of	a	body,	the	body	of	Christ,	is	all	about.

CHAPTER	19
Straight	Talk	To	Those	Who	Want	To	Come	Out	Of	The	Occult

REBECCA	TALKS:
I	want	to	speak	directly	to	those	reading	this	book	who	are	involved	in	the	occult
(i.e.	Satanism)	and	want	to	leave.	What	I	have	to	say	to	you	will	seem	harsh,	but
it	is	the	honest	truth	based	on	God’s	word.	There	is	no	easy	way	out.	Jesus	is	not
an	easy	escape	route.	Jesus	has	all	power	and	authority	over	Satan	and	his
demons	and	that	power	can	be	available	to	you,	but	you	chose	to	serve	Satan,
and	Satan	does	not	give	up	his	servants	easily.	This	is	just	a	plain	fact.	You	will
have	to	fight	to	be	free.	Your	only	hope	is	to	fight	with	the	power	and	authority
of	Jesus	Christ.	But	the	battle	is	real.	Leaving	occult	involvements	is	an	all-ornothing	thing.	You	cannot	partially	or	gradually	leave	Satanism.	You	must	make
up	your	mind	to	totally	leave	it	once	and	for	all.	If	you	try	to	go	back	you	will
probably	be	killed	and	you	will	never	have	another	chance	to	leave.	This	is
serious	business.
“For	it	is	impossible	for	those	who	were	once	enlightened,	and	have
tasted	of	the	heavenly	gift,	and	were	made	partakers	of	the	Holy	Ghost,
And	have	tasted	the	good	word	of	God,	and	the	powers	of	the	world	to
come,	if	they	shall	fall	away,	to	renew	them	again	unto	repentance;
seeing	they	crucify	to	themselves	the	Son	of	God	afresh,	and	put	him	to
an	open	shame.”	Hebrews	6:4-6
Once	you	have	tasted	of	the	power	and	goodness	of	Jesus	Christ	and	His
salvation,	if	you	turn	back	to	the	occult	you	will	never	be	able	to	repent	again,
and	you	will	spend	an	eternity	in	the	most	agonizing	torment	in	Hell.
“Jesus	saith	unto	him,	I	am	the	way,	the	truth,
and	the	life:	no	man	cometh	unto	the	Father,	but
by	me.”
John	14:6
There	is	only	one	way	to	come	to	God	the	Father	and	be	set	free	from	Satan’s
kingdom,	that	is	by	Jesus	Christ.	If	you	want	to	break	free	from	bondage	to
Satan	you	can	do	it	only	by	making	Jesus	your	Lord	and	Savior	and	total
Master.	You	cannot	serve	Jesus	and	Satan	at	the	same	time,	and	if	you	are	not
totally	serving	Jesus,	then	you	ARE	serving	Satan.	All	you	need	to	do	is	speak

out	and	ask	Jesus	to	forgive	you,	wash	away	all	your	sins	with	His	precious
blood	shed	on	the	cross,	and	ask	Him	to	take	complete	control	of	your	life.	The
demons	in	you	and	around	you	will	do	anything	to	keep	you	from	doing	this,	but
they	cannot	stop	you.
“Let	every	one	that	nameth	the	name	of	Christ	depart	from	iniquity.
[evil]”	II	Timothy	2:19b
You	must	make	a	complete	and	total	break	with	all	evil.	I	am	well	aware	that
this	will	be	a	most	difficult	thing	to	do,	as	nearly	everything	you	have	has	been
given	to	you	by	Satan.	You	must	give	up	all	your	powers	of	witchcraft	—	this
especially	includes	your	ability	to	communicate	with	the	spirit	world.	You	must
ask	the	Lord	to	take	away	all	of	your	powers,	and	take	them	away	so	completely
that	even	should	you	rebel	and	try	to	get	them	back	you	could	not.	You	must	ask
the	Lord	to	sever	between	your	soul	and	spirit	so	that	you	completely	and
forever	lose	your	ability	to	communicate	with	Satan	and	his	demons,	or	use	your
own	spirit	body.	You	cannot	use	your	witchcraft,	even	to	protect	yourself.
“For	the	word	of	God	is	quick,	and	powerful,	and	sharper	than	any	twoedged	sword,	piercing	even	to	the	dividing	asunder	of	soul	and	spirit,	and
of	the	joints	and	marrow,	and	is	a	discerner	of	the	thoughts	and	intents	of
the	heart.	Neither	is	there	any	creature	that	is	not	manifest	in	his	sight:
but	all	things	are	naked	and	opened	unto	the	eyes	of	him	with	whom	we
have	to	do.”	Hebrews	4:12-13
You	cannot	hide	anything	from	God!	You	must	make	a	total	break	with
everything	evil.	If	you	are	living	with	others	still	involved	in	Satanism	such	as	in
a	commune,	you	must	get	out,	no	matter	what	the	cost.	You	must	understand	that
you	cannot	continue	to	even	associate	with	friends	or	relatives	who	persist	in
serving	Satan.	You	will	come	under	heavy	influence	and	attack	especially	by
family	members	remaining	in	Satanism.
“But	when	they	persecute	you	in	this	city,	flee	ye	into	another	...”
Matthew	10:23
Once	you	have	asked	Jesus	Christ	to	forgive	you	and	cleanse	you	and	to	become
your	Lord	and	Master,	you	will	have	His	power	and	authority	over	the	demons
within	you	and	around	you.
Don’t	try	to	fool	yourself.	Just	because	you	have	asked	Jesus	to	save	you	the
demons	didn’t	politely	say	“good	by”	and	hop	out	of	you.	You	asked	them	in	by
serving	Satan,	now	the	Lord	expects	YOU	to	take	up	the	power	and	authority

available	to	you	in	the	name	of	Jesus	and	kick	them	out.	You	must	understand
that	the	demons	inside	you	are	committed	to	killing	you	even	if	the	satanists
don’t	get	to	you	physically.
Don’t	let	the	demons	control	you.	You	must	now	control	them.	Rebuke	them	out
loud	in	the	name	of	Jesus	and	command	them	to	come	out	of	you	and	leave	you
in	the	name	of	Jesus.
“And	these	signs	shall	follow	them	that	believe;	in	my	name	shall	they
cast	out	devils...”	Mark	16:17
“Behold,	I	give	unto	you	power	to	tread	on	serpents	and	scorpions,	and
over	all	the	power	of	the	enemy...”
Luke	10:19
You	need	help.	Pray	and	ask	the	Lord	to	lead	you	to	Christian	brothers	and
sisters	who	are	able	and	willing	to	help	you,	but	be	careful.	Satan	has	many
servants	in	the	Christian	churches	and	there	are	many	Christians	who	are	not
fully	committed	to	the	Lord.	Seek	the	Lord’s	confirmation	and	guidance	before
you	trust	anyone.	You	will	most	likely	need	help	to	be	able	to	obtain	complete
deliverance	from	the	demons	within	you.	Complete	deliverance	IS	possible	—
don’t	let	anyone	tell	you	otherwise.	Seek	complete	deliverance	as	quickly	as
possible.	As	you	seek	the	Lord	earnestly,	He	will	hear	you	and	will	help	you.
You	must	read	and	study	and	learn	God’s	word.	Obedience	to	God	is	an
absolute	necessity.
[Jesus	said]	“If	ye	love	me,	keep	my	commandments.”	John	14:15
[Jesus	speaking]	“If	ye	keep	my	commandments,	ye	shall	abide	in	my
love;	even	as	I	have	kept	my	Father’s	commandments,	and	abide	in	his
love.”	John	15:10	“Not	every	one	that	saith	unto	me,	Lord,	Lord,	shall
enter	into	the	kingdom	of	heaven;	but	he	that	doeth	the	will	of	my	Father
which	is	in	heaven.”
Matthew	7:21
Your	best	protection	against	Satan’s	attacks	is	instant	obedience	to	God’s
commands	—	not	only	those	commands	found	in	the	Bible,	but	also	those	given
to	you	by	the	Holy	Spirit	directly.	You	must	understand	that	you	are	basically	a
rebellious	person	or	you	wouldn’t	have	been	involved	in	the	occult	in	the	first
place.	Satanism	attracts	people	because	they	want	power	to	control	their	own
lives	and	the	lives	of	others.	The	issue	of	the	mastership	of	Jesus	will	be	an	area

in	your	life	where	Satan	will	attack	hard.	He	will	put	all	sorts	of	questions	into
your	mind	such	as	“Why	should	I	always	have	to	do	everything	the	Lord’s	way?
It’s	my	life	after	all.”	No	it	isn’t.	Don’t	ever	forget,	you	have	been	bought	with	a
terrible	price	—	the	sufferings	of	Jesus	on	the	cross.
You	belong	to	the	Lord	now.	The	scriptures	are	very	clear	on	this	matter:
“For	rebellion	is	as	the	sin	of	witchcraft,	and	stubbornness	is	as	iniquity
and	idolatry.”	I	Samuel	15:23
You	must	study	and	memorize	God’s	word.	This	is	your	safeguard.	God	himself
will	give	you	the	understanding	of	the	scriptures.	Don’t	accept	anything	anyone
else	tells	you	without	checking	it	out	with	the	scriptures	and	asking	the	Lord
about	it.
You	will	probably	experience	a	total	change	in	your	life	circumstances	—
especially	financially.	Don’t	forget,	everything	you	have	you	received	from
Satan,	it	all	belongs	to	him	and	he	has	the	legal	right	to	take	it	away	from	you.
God	is	absolutely	just	with	Satan	as	well	as	with	us.	But	take	courage,	the	riches
the	Lord	will	give	you	will	be	worth	far	more	than	anything	Satan	could	possibly
give	to	you.
“Lay	not	up	for	yourselves	treasures	upon	earth,	where	moth	and	rust
doth	corrupt,	and	where	thieves	break	through	and	steal:	But	lay	up	for
yourselves	treasures	in	heaven,	where	neither	moth	nor	rust	doth	corrupt,
and	where	thieves	do	not	break	through	nor	steal:	for	where	your	treasure
is,	there	will	your	heart	be	also.”	Matthew	6:19-21
The	truest	treasure	you	can	ever	have	is	a	personal	knowledge	of	God.	Ask	Him
to	reveal	Himself	to	you.
Jesus	asked	Peter,	and	asks	each	one	of	us	today	this	pointed	question:	“	...
lovest	thou	me	more	than	these?”	John	21:15b
The	mastership	of	Jesus	is	absolute:
“He	that	loveth	father	or	mother	more	than	me	is	not	worthy	of	me:	and
he	that	loveth	son	or	daughter	more	than	me	is	not	worthy	of	me.	And	he
that	taketh	not	his	cross,	and	followeth	after	me,	is	not	worthy	of	me.”
Matthew	10:37-38
You	will	be	directly	challenged	by	Satan	on	this	issue.	Are	you	willing	to	put	the
Lord	Jesus	Christ	before	everything	and	everyone	else?	If	Jesus	does	not	come
before	your	loved	ones,	then	your	hopes	of	escaping	Satan	are	empty.	Satan	will
use	your	loved	ones	to	keep	you	in	bondage.	Let	me	give	you	an	example	of

use	your	loved	ones	to	keep	you	in	bondage.	Let	me	give	you	an	example	of
what	I	mean.
We	had	the	privilege	of	working	with	a	beautiful	negro	couple	whom	we	will
call	“the	Blacks.”	They	were	both	in	their	late	20s,	were	very	intelligent,	and	had
reached	a	fairly	high	position	within	The	Brotherhood	locally.	They	committed
their	lives	to	Jesus	and	refused	to	serve	Satan	any	longer.	We	advised	them	to
move	out	of	state,	but	they	were	understandably	hesitant	to	do	so	as	Mr.	Black
had	a	very	good	paying	job.	They	had	two	children,	a	girl	four	years	old,	and	a
boy	two	years	old.	They	experienced	a	terrible	test	of	their	commitment	to	Jesus.
About	6	months	after	they	came	out	of	Satanism,	Mr.	&	Mrs.	Black	and	their	4year-old	daughter	were	kidnapped	by	The	Brotherhood.	They	were	taken	to	a
meeting	where	their	little	girl	was	literally	skinned	alive	before	their	horrified
eyes.	They	were	told	repeatedly	that	the	torture	of	their	daughter	would	be
stopped	only	if	they	both	renounced	Jesus	Christ	and	proclaimed	Satan	as	Lord
and	agreed	to	serve	Satan	again.
Despite	the	unspeakable	anguish	they	experienced	as	they	were	forced	to	watch
their	beloved	child	being	tortured	and	hear	her	screams	of	agony,	they	held	firm.
They	had	put	Jesus	first	in	their	lives	and	would	not	deny	His	Lordship.	Finally
their	little	girl	died	and	they	were	released	by	their	captors.	A	week	later,	their
son	became	violently	ill.	He	was	hospitalized	and	seen	by	the	leading	specialists
in	the	area	—	all	to	no	avail.	He	died	within	48	hours,	the	doctors	never	did	find
out	what	was	wrong	with	him.	He	was	obviously	killed	by	witchcraft.	Again,
Mr.	&	Mrs.	Black	stood	firm	and	continued	to	serve	Jesus.
Shortly	after	the	double	tragedy	they	moved	out	of	the	state.	We	stayed	in	touch
with	them	occasionally.	Two	years	later,	Mrs.	Black	gave	birth	to	twins,	a	boy
and	a	girl.	Mr.
Black	was	studying	to	become	a	minister.
You	may	be	saying,	“How	can	this	be,	why	didn’t	the	Lord	protect	their	children
once	they	became	Christians?”	This	is	not	a	game!	When	you	make	that
complete	commitment	to	Jesus	Christ	you	give	everything	to	Him.	You	may	be
sure	Satan	is	going	to	petition	the	Lord	for	everything	you	committed	to	the	Lord
just	as	he	did	in	Job’s	case.	Father	may	give	Satan	permission	to	take	what	he
petitions	for.
“For	my	thoughts	are	not	your	thoughts,	neither
are	your	ways	my	ways,	saith	the	Lord.	For	as

are	your	ways	my	ways,	saith	the	Lord.	For	as
the	heavens	are	higher	than	the	earth,	so	are	my
ways	higher	than	your	ways,	and	my	thoughts
than	your	thoughts.”
Isaiah	55:8-9
GOD	IS	GOD.	We	cannot	begin	to	understand	His	thoughts	or	the	reasons	why
He	does	what	He	does.	Terrible	as	it	was,	the	sacrifice	the	Blacks	made	to	serve
Jesus	pales	to	nothing	when	compared	with	what	Jesus	sacrificed	and	suffered
for	us	on	the	cross.	Jesus	tells	us	plainly:
“Fear	none	of	those	things	which	thou	shalt	suffer:	behold,	the	devil	shall
cast	some	of	you	into	prison,	that	ye	may	be	tried;	and	ye	shall	have
tribulation	ten	days:	be	thou	faithful	unto	death,	and	I	will	give	thee	a
crown	of	life.”	Revelation	2:10
“And	fear	not	them	which	kill	the	body,	but	are	not	able	to	kill	the	soul:
but	rather	fear	him	which	is	able	to	destroy	both	soul	and	body	in	hell.”
Matthew	10:28
Let	me	make	one	thing	very	clear.	This	battle	is	very	real	and	deadly.	I	am	well
aware	that	many	will	strongly	disagree	with	me	and	flatly	refuse	to	accept	what	I
am	going	to	say.	But,	I,	on	my	part,	must	speak	as	my	Master,	Jesus	has
commanded	me,	regardless	of	opposition.
Any	Christian	entering	true	spiritual	warfare	and	any	Christian	serving	Jesus
Christ	who	was	once	a	servant	of	Satan,	must	expect	persecution,	suffering,	and
battle	wounds.	And,	you	will	probably	not	receive	immediate	relief	or	healing
for	any	of	these.
“Yea	and	all	that	will	live	godly	in	Christ	Jesus
shall	suffer	persecution.”	II	Timothy	3:12
Just	how	much	are	you	willing	to	suffer	for	the	Lord?	(I	am	speaking	of
suffering	physically,	mentally,	emotionally,	spiritually	and	financially.)	What
price	do	you	put	on	a	soul?	What	price	are	you	willing	to	pay	to	bring	about	the
salvation	of	a	soul,	or	to	refuse	to	serve	Satan	and	honor	the	Lord	Jesus	Christ
who	set	you	free	from	bondage	to	Satan?	Jesus	was	willing	to	pay	a	very	big
price	—	unbelieveable	suffering	and	death!
“Who,	[Jesus]	being	in	the	form	of	God,	thought	it	not	robbery	to	be
equal	with	God:	But	made	himself	of	no	reputation,	and	took	upon	him

equal	with	God:	But	made	himself	of	no	reputation,	and	took	upon	him
the	form	of	a	servant,	and	was	made	in	the	likeness	of	men:	And	being
found	in	fashion	as	a	man,	he	humbled	himself,	and	became	obedient
unto	death,	even	the	death	of	the	cross.	Wherefore	God	also	hath	highly
exalted	him,	and	given	him	a	name	which	is	above	every	name:	That	at
the	name	of	Jesus	every	knee	should	bow,	of	things	in	heaven,	and	things
in	earth,	and	things	under	the	earth;	And	that	every	tongue	should
confess	that	Jesus	Christ	is	Lord,	to	the	glory	of	God	the	Father.”
Philippians	2:6-11
But,	people	will	say,	“In	Christ	we	have	victory,	not	defeat.”	That	is	true.	Indeed
the	purpose	of	this	whole	book	and	our	lives	is	to	declare	that	victory.	But	that
victory	is	not	always	instantaneous	in	our	physical	world	of	time.	There	is	often
much	struggling	and	battling	and	suffering	to	be	done	first.	Ultimately,	in	the
end,	we	will	have	complete	victory	in	Jesus,	every	ear	will	be	wiped	away	by
God	Himself	and	we	will	spend	all	eternity	in	one	long	joyous	celebration	of	that
victory.
In	the	meantime,	when	we	are	in	the	middle	of	suffering	that	is	beyond	our
ability	to	endure,	what	is	our	hope?	How	do	we	cope?	Often	in	such	a	situation
eternity	seems	so	nebulous	and	far	off	that	the	thoughts	of	it	bring	little	comfort.
How	often	have	I	been	given	the	trite	answer,	“Oh,	don’t	worry,	God	won’t	let
you	have	more	than	you	can	bare!”	That	is	wrong	and	a	misquotation	of	the
scripture.	The	scripture	being	referred	to	is:
“Wherefore	let	him	that	thinketh	he	standeth
take	heed	lest	he	fall.	There	hath	no	temptation
taken	you	but	such	as	is	common	to	man:	but
God	is	faithful,	who	will	not	suffer	you	to	be
tempted	above	that	ye	are	able;	but	will	with	the
temptation	also	make	a	way	to	escape,	that	ye
may	be	able	to	bear	it.”
I	Corinthians	10:12-13
There	is	a	vast	difference	between	temptation	and	suffering.	Paul	wrote	very
clearly	in	II	Corinthians	1:8:
“For	we	would	not,	brethren,	have	you	ignorant	of	our	trouble	which
came	to	us	in	Asia,	that	we	were	pressed	out	of	measure,	above	strength,
insomuch	that	we	despaired	even	of	life.”

insomuch	that	we	despaired	even	of	life.”
Consider	the	following	scripture:
“Wherefore	when	we	could	no	longer	forbear,
we	thought	it	good	to	be	left	at	Athens	alone;
and	sent	Timotheus,	our	brother,	and	minister	of
God,	and	our	fellow	laborer	in	the	gospel	of
Christ,	to	establish	you,	and	to	comfort	you
concerning	your	faith:	That	no	man	should	be
moved	by	these	afflictions:	for	yourselves	know
that	we	are	appointed	thereunto.	For	verily,
when	we	were	with	you,	we	told	you	before	that
we	should	suffer	tribulation;	even	as	it	came	to
pass,	and	ye	know.”	I	Thessalonians	3:1-4
So	what	is	the	help,	or	hope,	or	answer?	I	speak	out	of	my	own	experience,
having	been	for	more	than	three	years	in	the	midst	of	suffering	and	under
pressures	far	beyond	my	ability	to	endure	with	no	relief	in	sight.	I	know	beyond
a	shadow	of	a	doubt	that	I	will	inherit	a	“Crown	of	Life”	and	have	great	joy
throughout	eternity.	But	in	all	honesty	that	does	not	ease	my	hurt	much	now.	I
have	no	“pat”	answer.	All	I	can	say	is	that	as	I	firmly	place	my	feet	on	“The
Rock”	(Jesus	Christ),	and	day	by	day,	with	many	tears,	ask	the	Lord	to	give	me
His	strength	and	grace	to	continue	standing,	I	experience	the	reality	of	those
beautiful	verses	which	say:
“Blessed	be	God,	even	the	Father	of	our	Lord	Jesus	Christ,	the	Father	of
mercies,	and	the	God	of	all	comfort;	Who	comforteth	us	in	all	our
tribulation,	that	we	may	be	able	to	comfort	them	which	are	in	any
trouble,	by	the	comfort	wherewith	we	ourselves	are	comforted	of	God.
For	as	the	sufferings	of	Christ	abound	in	us,	so	our	consolation	also
aboundeth	by	Christ.”	II	Corinthians	1:3-5
As	I	continue	to	stand	firm,	the	Lord	helps	me	carry	the	suffering	and	pressure
and	grief	so	that	I	am	not	overwhelmed	unto	death;	so	that	I	can	continue	with
the	work	which	is	given	me	to	do,	having	the	full	assurance	that:
“	...for	I	know	whom	I	have	believed,	and	am	persuaded	that	he	is	able	to
keep	that	which	I	have	committed	unto	him	against	that	day.”	II	Timothy
1:12b
Often	we	will	find	ourselves	in	a	position	where	we	have	done	all	that	we	know

Often	we	will	find	ourselves	in	a	position	where	we	have	done	all	that	we	know
to	do	and	yet	the	situation	continues	to	seem	hopeless.	Then	we	must	remember
Paul’s	wise	counsel	in	Ephesians:
“Wherefore	take	unto	you	the	whole	armor	of	God,	that	ye	may	be	able
to	withstand	in	the	evil	day,	and	having	done	all,	to	stand.”	Ephesians
6:13
Simply	standing,	holding	our	ground	in	Christ	Jesus	and	waiting	on	Him	is	the
hardest	thing	we	will	ever	have	to	do.	So	let	us	stand	my	dear	brothers	and
sisters	in	Christ.	Let	us	stand	together	with	the	knowledge	that:
“Though	I	walk	in	the	midst	of	trouble,	thou	wilt	revive	me:	thou	shalt
stretch	forth	thine	hand	against	the	wrath	of	mine	enemies,	and	thy	right
hand	shall	save	me.	The	Lord	will	perfect	that	which	concerneth	me:
[will	fulfill	his	purpose	for	me]	thy	mercy,	O	Lord,	endureth	for	ever	...	”
Psalm	138:7-8
No	matter	what	happens,	the	great,	incredible	God	of	the	universe	has	a	purpose
for	you.	For	YOU!	You,	as	an	individual	and	He	will	fulfill	it.	All	the	forces	of
Satan	and	his	vast	army	cannot	stop	God	from	fulfilling	His	purpose	for	you.
Many	things	you	do	not	understand	and	will	never	understand	while	here	on	this
earth.	Whatever	the	outcome	may	be	—	be	it	life,	or	death,	or	continued
suffering	to	the	end	—	this	you	can	know	and	rest	in:	day	by	day,	somehow,
someway	that	you	may	not	understand,	God	is	fulfilling	His	purpose	for	you	and
His	love	for	you	endures	forever!
Don’t	give	up!	The	Lord	will	set	you	free	from	bondage	to	Satan.	Only	the	Lord
can	set	you	free	—	you	are	not	stronger	than	or	more	intelligent	than	the
demons!	You	cannot	do	anything	yourself,	but	Jesus	can	and	will!

Jesus	came	to	set	the	captives	free!

CHAPTER	20
Definitions

REBECCA	TALKS:
Perhaps	it	would	be	well	to	give	definitions	of	some	of	the	most	commonly	used
occult	terms.	The	list	here	could	be	very	long,	but	we	have	chosen	to	limit	it	to
only	the	most	commonly	used	terms	the	Christian	is	likely	to	come	across.

FAMILIAR	OBJECTS
These	are	objects	to	which	demons	cling.	Anything	used	in	the	worship	of	Satan
or	in	serving	Satan	is	legal	ground	for	demons.	In	other	words	the	demons	have	a
right	to	cling	to	or	use	such	objects.	Let	us	look	at	a	couple	of	scriptures	that
pertain	to	this.
“The	graven	images	of	their	gods	shall	ye	burn	with	fire:	thou	shalt	not
desire	the	silver	or	gold	that	is	on	them,	nor	take	it	unto	thee,	lest	thou	be
snared	therein:	for	it	is	an	abomination	to	the	Lord	thy	God.	Neither	shalt
thou	bring	an	abomination	into	thine	house,	lest	thou	be	a	cursed	thing
like	it:	but	thou	shalt	utterly	detest	it,	and	thou	shalt	utterly	abhor	it;	for	it
is	a	cursed	thing.”	Deuteronomy	7:25-26	“What	say	I	then?	That	the	idol
is	any	thing,	or	that	which	is	offered	in	a	sacrifice	to	idols	is	any	thing?
But	I	say,	that	the	things	which	the	Gentiles	sacrifice,	they	sacrifice	to
devils,	and	not	to	God:	and	I	would	not	that	ye	should	have	fellowship
with	devils.”
I	Corinthians	10:19-20
These	two	scriptures	show	that	the	idols	represent	demons.	The	passage
in	Deuteronomy	clearly	shows	that	all	such	things	used	in	the	service	of
Satan	are	an	abomination	unto	the	Lord,	even	the	gold	and	silver	on	them
cannot	be	used	—	it	must	all	be	destroyed.	God	has	a	purpose	for	every
command.	He	did	not	want	the	Israelites	bringing	such	“demonically
contaminated”	objects	into	their	homes	because	of	the	effect	they	would
have	on	them.	God	warned	them	that	they	would	also	become	“a	cursed
thing.”	Why?	Because	the	powerful	influence	exerted	by	the	demons
would	cause	them	to	fall	into	demon	worship	themselves.
The	seriousness	of	God’s	concern	about	these	objects	used	in	Satan’s	service	is
demonstrated	over	and	over	again	in	the	scriptures.	Read	the	story	of	Achan	in
Joshua	chapter	7.	God	commanded	the	Israelites	not	to	take	any	spoils	from	the
city	of	Jericho.	The	entire	city	of	Jericho	was	involved	in	worshiping	and	serving
Satan.	But	Achan	took	some	of	the	articles	from	the	city.	God	told	Joshua:
“Israel	hath	sinned,	and	they	have	also	transgressed	my	covenant	which	I
commanded	them:	for	they	have	even	taken	of	the	accursed	thing,	and
have	also	stolen,	and	dissembled	also,	and	they	have	put	it	even	among

their	own	stuff.”	Joshua	7:11
As	a	result	of	Achan’s	actions	the	entire	army	of	Israel	was	defeated	in	their	next
battle.	This	is	a	very	solemn	warning	to	us.	If	we	have	not	cleaned	out	our	homes
as	well	as	our	lives,	we	will	be	defeated	every	time	we	try	to	fight	against	Satan.
Common	familiar	objects	include:	any	occult	object	used	in	the	practice	of	the
occult	arts,	any	Rock	&	Roll	records,	tapes,	posters,	T-shirts,	etc.,	any	material
from	occultic	role-playing	fantasy	games,	any	artifacts	of	Eastern	religions	such
as	the	little	statues	of	gods	people	buy	as	souvenirs	while	traveling,	any	rosaries
or	objects	used	in	the	practice	of	Catholicism,	any	articles	used	in	the	practice	of
Masonry,	any	literature	or	tapes	on	the	occult	or	pagan	religions,	and	so	on	—
the	list	is	nearly	endless.	All	such	materials	must	be	destroyed.	I	think	the
Ephesians	set	an	excellent	New	Testament	example	for	us	in	Acts:
“And	this	was	known	to	all	the	Jews	and	Greeks
also	dwelling	at	Ephesus;	and	fear	fell	on	them
all,	and	the	name	of	the	Lord	Jesus	was
magnified.	And	many	that	believed	came,	and
confessed,	and	shewed	their	deeds.	Many	of
them	also	which	used	curious	arts	[occult	arts]
brought	their	books	together,	and	burned	them
before	all	men:	and	they	counted	the	price	of
them,	and	found	it	fifty	thousand	pieces	of
silver.”
Acts	19:17-19
There	is	another	type	of	familiar	object	as	well.	Satan’s	servants	can	call	up
demons	and	attach	them	to	specific	non-occult	objects,	then	present	the	object	as
a	gift	to	someone,	there-by	placing	the	demon	directly	into	their	home	without
their	awareness	of	what	has	happened.	The	purpose	of	these	demons	is	to	exert	a
strong	demonic	influence	to	produce	such	things	as	marital	discord,	strife
amongst	family	members,	illness,	depression,	difficulty	praying,	difficulty
reading	the	Bible,	and	so	on.	These	objects	usually	do	not	need	to	be	destroyed.
A	simple	anointing	with	oil	and	prayer	asking	the	Lord	to	sanctify	and	cleanse
the	object	is	usually	sufficient.	This	is	according	to	the	principle	God	gave
Moses	in	Exodus	40:9ff:
“And	thou	shalt	take	the	anointing	oil,	and	anoint	the	tabernacle,	and	all
that	is	therein,	and	shalt	hallow	it,	and	all	the	vessels	thereof:	and	it	shall

that	is	therein,	and	shalt	hallow	it,	and	all	the	vessels	thereof:	and	it	shall
be	holy.”	“Whoso	boasteth	himself	of	a	false	gift	is	like	clouds	and	wind
without	rain.”	Proverbs	25:14
Christians	must	be	alert	and	very	cautious	about	receiving	any	gift	from
someone	they	do	not	know	well	enough	to	know	where	he/she	stands	with	the
Lord.	This	is	an	area	where	we	must	be	very	sensitive	to	the	Lord’s	guidance.

FAMILIAR	SPIRITS
“There	shall	not	be	found	among	you	any	one	that	maketh	his	son	or	his
daughter	to	pass	through	the	fire,	or	that	useth	divination,	or	an	observer
of	times,	or	an	enchanter,	or	a	witch,	or	a	charmer,	or	a	consulter	with
familiar	spirits,	or	a	wizard,	or	a	necromancer.”	Deuteronomy	18:10-11
A	familiar	spirit	is	a	demon	with	whom	a	witch	has	developed	close
communication.	Such	demons	are	used	in	many	ways.	In	our	times,	a	familiar
spirit	is	used	primarily	for	spying	and	information	gathering	purposes.	For
instance,	the	term	a	“witch’s	familiar”	is	often	used	in	reference	to	some	animal.
In	this	instance	the	demon	is	placed	within	the	animal	and	the	witch	can	then,
through	her	communication	with	that	demon,	both	control	the	animal	and	see
and	hear	everything	the	animal	sees	and	hears.	Also,	a	witch	may	astral	project
her	(or	his)	own	human	spirit	into	an	animal	and	then	control	the	animal	for	her
own	use.	People	in	the	occult	often	form	a	very	close	link	with	an	animal	or	bird
that	is	used	in	this	way.	Traditionally	witches	are	thought	to	use	black	cats.	This
is	a	lie	spread	by	Satan’s	servants	for	the	purpose	of	misleading	people.	Witches
can	and	do	frequently	use	cats	for	such	purposes,	but	they	prefer	pure	white	cats,
because	white	stands	for	purity.
An	incident	with	a	familiar	spirit	happened	in	my	own	office	just	recently.	I	am
very	much	an	animal	lover.	I	have	a	couple	of	cats	who	love	to	ride	in	the	car
and	I	usually	take	one	or	both	to	the	office	each	day.	Normally	we	keep	them
closed	in	an	area	where	they	do	not	come	into	contact	with	the	patients.	That
particular	evening,	one	of	my	last	patients	was	a	fairly	powerful	local	warlock.	I
do	not	think	that	at	that	point	he	had	any	idea	I	knew	his	true	identity.
Somehow,	that	evening	Joshua,	my	cat,	got	loose	and	came	into	the	room	where
the	patient	was.	I	grabbed	him	up	before	the	patient	had	the	opportunity	to	touch
him	saying:
“I’m	sorry,	Joshua	got	loose	somehow,	I	hope	you	don’t	mind	cats?”
“Not	at	all,	in	fact	we	have	a	cat	ourselves	whom	we	love	very	much.”
As	I	carried	Joshua	out	of	the	room	the	Lord	revealed	to	me	that	I	was	too	late.
The	patient	had	succeeded	in	putting	a	familiar	spirit	demon	into	him.	One
second,	that’s	all	it	took!
After	all	the	patients	were	gone,	I	was	sitting	in	my	personal	office	talking	with

After	all	the	patients	were	gone,	I	was	sitting	in	my	personal	office	talking	with
two	friends.	The	change	in	Joshua	was	remarkable.	Normally	he	is	an	extremely
calm	and	quiet	cat.	But	as	we	sat	talking,	he	paced	continuously	from	one	to	the
other	of	us,	looking	up	at	each	one	of	us	as	we	talked.	I	explained	to	the	others
what	had	happened.	The	patient	was	using	the	cat’s	eyes	and	ears	to	monitor	all
that	was	going	on.	I	picked	up	Joshua	and	looking	directly	into	his	now	glaring
eyes	said:
“Now	you	listen	to	me,	Jimmy	(the	patient’s	name).	Your	master	Satan	is	a	liar.
He	is	not	stronger	than	Jesus.	Jesus	Christ	is	God	and	He	died	on	the	cross	for
you	as	well	as	me.	Jesus	is	the	one	you	should	be	serving,	not	Satan.	Now	I’m
going	to	prove	to	you	that	what	I	am	saying	is	true.	We	are	going	to	cast	your
familiar	spirit	out	of	this	animal	with	the	power	of	Jesus	Christ.	If	Satan	is	as
strong	as	he	says	he	is	we	should	not	be	able	to	do	this.”
I	then	took	some	oil	and	anointed	Joshua	and	we	joined	in	prayer	asking	our
Lord	Jesus	to	cast	out	the	demon.	Again,	the	change	was	immediate.	The	glare
left	his	eyes,	he	stopped	struggling	and	with	a	big	sigh	lay	down	and	promptly
fell	asleep.
If	you	have	pets,	always	be	alert	to	the	possibility	of	their	having	familiar	spirits,
but	please	be	sure	to	briefly	share	the	gospel	before	casting	out	the	demon	or
asking	the	Lord	to	remove	the	human	spirit.	Usually	you	will	not	know	if	you
are	dealing	solely	with	a	human	spirit	or	with	a	demon,	and	whenever	possible
you	want	the	satanist	involved	to	hear	the	gospel.	We	daily	pray	for	special
shielding	of	our	animals.
Animals	are	usually	easily	cleared	because	they	do	not	sin,	therefore	Satan	has
no	legal	ground	in	them	in	the	same	way	he	does	humans.	However,	they	have
been	affected	by	the	curse	of	sin.	The	scriptures	make	this	very	plain.
“For	we	know	that	the	whole	creation	groaneth	and	travaileth	in	pain
together	until	now.”	Romans	8:22.
In	the	end,	all	of	creation,	including	the	animals,	will	be	made	new	through	Jesus
Christ	to	remove	the	curse	of	sin.
“For	it	pleased	the	Father	that	in	him	[Jesus]	should	all	fulness	dwell;
And,	having	made	peace	through	the	blood	of	his	cross,	by	him	to
reconcile	all	things	unto	himself;	by	him,	I	say,	whether	they	be	things	in
earth,	or	things	in	heaven.”	Colossians	1:19-20.
In	Biblical	days,	the	term	familiar	spirit	seemed	to	refer	more	to	a	witch	simply

consulting	with	a	demon.	A	most	interesting	example	is	found	in	I	Samuel	28.
Saul	was	at	the	end	of	his	career.	He	was	so	far	in	rebellion	against	God	that	he
decided	to	seek	out	a	woman	who	consulted	with	familiar	spirits	to	find	out	how
the	battle	of	the	next	day	would	end.	The	really	interesting	thing	in	this	story	is
the	fact	that	Saul	asked	the	woman	to	use	her	demons	to	call	up	the	dead	spirit	of
the	prophet	Samuel.	Obviously	the	woman	didn’t	hesitate	to	do	so,	expecting	her
demon	to	come	up	and	masquerade	as	Samuel.	But	God	actually	sent	Samuel!
Verse	12	of	chapter	28	tells	us	that	when	the	woman	saw	that	the	real	Samuel
was	there	instead	of	a	demon	she	cried	out	and	was	terrified.
The	many	seances	that	are	held	to	supposedly	contact	the	dead	are	all	lies.	These
witches	cannot	actually	contact	the	dead.	This	scripture	shows	us	that	they	only
use	demons	who	masquerade	as	the	dead	person.	Satan	can	kill	humans
physically,	but	he	cannot	control	their	spirits	and	souls	after	death.	Jesus	said:
“But	I	say	unto	you	my	friends,	Be	not	afraid	of
them	that	kill	the	body,	and	after	that	have	no
more	that	they	can	do.	But	I	will	fore	warn	you
whom	ye	shall	fear:	Fear	him,	which	after	he
hath	killed	hath	power	to	cast	into	hell;	yea,	I
say	unto	you,	Fear	him.”
Luke	12:4-5
“The	fear	of	the	Lord	is	the	beginning	of
wisdom	...”
Proverbs	9:10
Our	Lord	clearly	tells	us	not	to	fear	the	physical	death	that	Satan	can	cause,	but
to	fear	rather	God,	who	is	able	to	cast	the	soul	and	spirit	into	hell	after	death.	I
believe	that	these	scriptures	and	others	clearly	show	that	Satan	and	his	demons
have	no	control	whatsoever	over	peoples’	souls	and	spirits	after	they	have	died.
One	other	scripture	that	is	particularly	pertinent	to	this	is	found	in	Revelation.
“[Jesus	speaking]	I	am	he	that	liveth,	and	was	dead;	and,	behold,	I	am
alive	for	evermore,	Amen;	and	have	the	keys	of	hell	and	of	death.”
Revelation	1:18

SPELLS,	INCANTATIONS,	HEXES	&	CURSES
All	of	these	accomplish	the	same	purpose	—	that	is,	to	summon	a	demon	or
demons	to	perform	a	given	action.	Frequently	incantations	are	in	poetic	form,
they	are	multitudinous	and	have	been	passed	down	from	generation	to
generation.	They	are	usually	spoken	aloud	(remember,	demons	cannot	read	the
human	mind),	but	often	are	spoken	by	the	witch’s	spirit	into	the	spirit	world
which	is	not	audible	to	the	physical	ear.
The	term	“Placing	a	spell,	hex,	or	curse	on	someone,”	refers	to	the	act	of	calling
up	a	demon	and	then	sending	it	to	the	person	to	perform	certain	influences	or
damage.	ALL	spells,	etc.,	are	accomplished	by	demons,	even	the	so-called
“good”	ones	such	as	those	stimulating	love	in	a	person,	etc.	Another	term	used
especially	in	some	other	countries	is	“bewitched,”	that	is,	someone	who	is	under
the	influence	or	control	of	demons	sent	by	a	witch.
The	more	powerful	witches	do	not	have	to	use	long	and	complex	incantations.
They	simply	communicate	with	the	demons	directly	in	the	spirit	world,	or
through	their	“guiding	spirit.”

GUIDING	SPIRIT
A	guiding	spirit	is	usually	a	powerful	demon	specifically	asked	by	a	witch	to
come	and	dwell	in	him/her	for	the	purpose	of	giving	them	all	sorts	of	occult
skills	and	powers	and	increased	communication	with	other	demons.	Mann-Chan
was	Elaine’s	guiding	spirit.	He	ruled	her	entire	life.	He	gave	her	the	many
abilities	detailed	earlier	in	the	book.
	

FETISH,	TALISMAN,	AMULET
These	three	terms	all	mean	about	the	same	thing.	They	refer	to	objects,	most
often	worn	or	hung	over	the	door	of	a	home,	which	are	supposed	to	bring
protection	and/or	good	fortune	to	the	owner.	Talismans	are	most	often	for	the
purpose	of	bringing	“good	luck.”
Amulets	and	fetishes	are	frequently	made	to	protect	a	person	from	a	particular
enemy,	such	as	another	witch.	In	these	cases,	something	from	the	enemy
(usually	hair)	is	incorporated	into	the	amulet	or	fetish.	These	vary	greatly	in
composition,	but	the	power	involved	is	the	same	in	all.	Demons!	The	Lord	has
no	such	objects!	The	Christian’s	power	is	only	through	our	Lord	Jesus	Christ
and	His	finished	work	on	the	cross.	Any	Christian	who	accepts	or	uses	such
things	is	directly	using	demons.	It	is	amazing	how	many	Christians	accept	such
things	as	a	crucifix	or	even	a	Bible	as	being	a	protection	in	just	the	same	manner
amulets	or	fetishes	are	used.	This	is	in	absolute	contradiction	of	God’s	word.
Marks	are	called	different	things	in	different	areas	of	the	world.	A	mark	is	in
essence	an	identifying	object.	When	a	witch	wishes	to	send	out	a	demon	against
another	person,	the	demon	does	not	automatically	know	who	that	person	is.	The
quickest,	most	effective	way	is	to	present	to	the	demon	some	identifying	object
or	mark,	such	as	the	person’s	hair,	fingernail	clippings,	etc.	Articles	of	clothing
are	sometimes	used,	but	are	not	as	effective	as	part	of	the	person.	These	marks
serve	to	identify	the	person	just	as	fingerprints	do.
We	have,	on	a	number	of	occasions,	had	problems	when	satanists	have	tried	to
kill	our	pets	with	witchcraft.	On	these	occasions,	we	have	noted	that	the
whiskers	have	been	cut	off	of	our	cats	and	dog	on	only	one	side.	We	have	lost
some	pets	from	demons	afflicting	them	with	illness,	but	we	continually	remain
alert	to	this	possibility	and	pray	for	them	and	anoint	them	with	oil	asking	the
Lord	for	special	shielding	for	them.	The	whiskers	taken	from	our	animals	were
the	“mark”	or	identifying	object	the	witches	gave	the	demons	to	use	to	identify
our	animals.

HAGSTONES
These	are	most	commonly	a	form	of	onyx,	but	may	be	made	up	of	any	crystal	or
gem.	The	purpose	of	a	hagstone	is	communication.	They	are	frequently	worn	as
a	piece	of	jewelry.	Special	incantations	are	used	over	these	stones	along	with
various	ways	of	rubbing	the	stone,	etc.	to	summon	the	necessary	demon	or
demons	to	take	communication	to	another	person.	Often	the	demon	will	cause
the	stone	to	glow	with	light	to	signify	his	presence.
	

FORCES	AND	POWERS
White	witchcraft	is	full	of	references	to	forces	and	powers.	As	an	example,	look
at	the	following	quote	from	a	book	on	White	witchcraft	called	Ritual	White
Magic	Tape	Instruction	Book,	by	Dick	Stephens	(Valley	of	the	Sun	Publishing
Co.,	1985).
“Magic	works	in	accordance	with	natural	laws	and	harnesses	and
employs	those	forces.	It	is	a	means	of	making	us	into	better,	wiser	people
and	is	an	extension	of	our	consciousness.	The	ultimate	aim	of	magic	is
for	the	practitioner	to	create	his	own	reality.	And	you	are	about	to	open
the	door	to	this	incredible	power	that	can	assist	you	to	do	exactly	that.”
p.3.
Many	other	descriptions	for	this	same	thing	are	used,	but	ultimately	all	white
witchcraft	comes	down	to	“uniting	the	person	with	the	forces	of	the	universe.”
Of	course	what	these	authors	always	neglect	to	say	is	the	fact	that	these	so	called
powers	and	forces	are	demons,	and	the	“extension	of	our	consciousness”	or
“altered	state-of-mind”	are	really	the	establishing	of	communication	with	the
spirit	world.
To	the	unwary	reader	it	all	sounds	so	good	and	harmless,	but	be	warned,	it	is
witchcraft	and	as	such	is	an	abomination	to	God.

In	Conclusion
Elaine	and	I	join	in	earnest	prayer	asking	the	Lord	of	lords	and	King	of	kings,
our	beloved	Jesus	Christ,	to	open	your	spiritual	understanding	to	all	that	we	have
attempted	to	say	in	this	book.	Remember	this,	no	matter	what	happens	to	you	in
battle,	or	as	a	result	of	entering	into	spiritual	warfare,	even	if	you	are	despairing
of	your	very	life;	you	will	always	be	in	the	center	of	our	God’s	love	and
guardianship.	Psalm	116:15	assures	us:	“Precious	in	the	sight	of	the	Lord	is	the
death	of	His	saints.”	God	jealously	guards	your	life.
In	closing	we	wish	to	commit	this	book,	with	all	the	love	our	hearts	can	hold,
into	the	hands	of	the	One	whom	we	love	above	everything	else:	God	the	Father,
God	the	Son,	and	God	the	Holy	Spirit.	May	all	love,	and	glory,	and	praise,	and
honor,	and	thanksgiving	be	given	to	Him	for	ever	and	ever!	Amen.
Please	come	quickly,	Lord	Jesus!

ADDENDUM
I	want	the	reader	to	understand	that	I	am	not	a	professional	writer.	I	apologize
for	any	place	where	I	do	not	make	myself	completely	clear.	I	decided	to	add	this
note	to	the	book	because	of	the	many	questions	I	have	received	about	the	terrible
struggle	I	had	with	the	demons	in	Elaine.	The	Lord	always	demands	complete
honesty.	I	had	to	write	about	my	failures	as	well	as	my	successes.	The	battle
with	the	demons	in	Elaine	was	my	training	ground.	I	freely	admit	that	I	did	not
know	what	I	was	doing.	I	learned	rapidly	through	searching	God’s	word	and	by
direct	guidance	from	the	Holy	Spirit.	The	wonderful	thing	is	that	our	Lord
honors	the	desires	of	our	hearts!	The	Lord	knew	that	I	was	desiring	to	serve
Him,	and	so	was	Elaine.	Thus,	no	matter	how	unskilled	we	were,	Jesus	was
faithful!
I	no	longer	have	the	struggles	with	demons	in	deliverance	that	I	did	with	Elaine.
I	have	learned	MUCH	since	then	and	am	continuing	to	learn.	Those	further
lessons	are	detailed	in	my	next	two	books,	“Prepare	For	War,”	and	“Becoming	A
Vessel	of	Honor	In	The	Master’s	Service.”	Yes,	I	have	suffered	much	and	have
struggled	much,	BUT,	this	is	a	book	of	VICTORY	not	defeat.	Elaine	and	many
others	have	been	set	free	through	the	power	of	Jesus	Christ.	We	are	all	imperfect
servants,	but	Jesus	Christ	is	perfect!	His	power	is	perfect	and	unlimited!	He	is
faithful	to	His	servants	now	and	forever.
